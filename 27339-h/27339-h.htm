<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p>Humdrum isn&#8217;t where you live; it&#8217;s what
you are. Perhaps you are one of those
whose lives are bound by neighbourly
interests. Imaginatively, you never seek what lies
under a gorgeous sunset; you are never stirred by
any longing to investigate the ends of rainbows.
You are more concerned by what your neighbour
does every day than by what he might do if he were
suddenly spun, whirled, jolted out of his poky
orbit. The blank door of an empty house never
intrigues you; you enter blind alleys without thrilling
in the least; you hear a cry in the night and
impute it to some marauding tom. Lord, what a
life!</p>
<p>And yet every move you make is governed by
Chance&mdash;the Blind Madonna of the Pagan, as
that great adventurer, Stevenson, called it. You
never stop to consider that it is only by chance
that you leave home and arrive at the office alive&mdash;millions
and millions of you&mdash;poor old stick-in-the-muds!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Because this or that hasn&#8217;t happened to
you, you can&#8217;t be made to believe that it might
have happened to someone else. What&#8217;s a wood
fire to you but a shin warmer? And how you hate
to walk alone! So sheer off&mdash;this is not for you.</p>
<p>But to you, fenced in by circumstance, walls of
breathless brick and stone, suffocating with longing,
you whose thought springs ever toward the
gorgeous sunset and the ends of rainbows; who
fly in dreams across the golden south seas to the
far countries, you whose imagination transforms
every ratty old square-rigger that pokes down the
bay into a Spanish galleon&mdash;come with me.</p>

<p>First off, Ling Foo, of Woosung Road, perhaps
the most bewildered Chinaman in all Shanghai
last April. The Blind Madonna flung him into a
great game and immediately cast him out of it,
giving him never an inkling of what the game was
about and leaving him buffeted by the four winds
of wonder.</p>
<p>A drama&mdash;he was sure of that&mdash;had rolled up,
touched him icily if slightly, and receded, like a
wave on the beach, without his knowing in the
least what had energized it in his direction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
During lulls, for years to come, Ling Foo&#8217;s consciousness
would strive to press behind the wall for a key
to the riddle; for years to come he would be searching
the International Bund, Nanking Road,
Broadway and Bubbling Well roads for the young
woman with the wonderful ruddy hair and the man
who walked with the sluing lurch.</p>
<p>Ah, but that man&mdash;the face of him, beautiful as
that of a foreign boy&#8217;s, now young, now old, as
though a cobweb shifted to and fro across it! The
fire in those dark eyes and the silk on that tongue!
Always that face would haunt him, because it
should not have been a man&#8217;s but a woman&#8217;s.
Ling Foo could not go to his gods for comparisons,
for a million variations of Buddha offered no such
countenance; so his recollection would always be
tinged with a restless sense of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>There were other faces in the picture, but with
the exception of the woman&#8217;s and the man&#8217;s he
could not reassemble the features of any.</p>
<p>A wild and bitter night. The nor&#8217;easter,
packed with a cold, penetrating rain, beat down
from the Yellow Sea, its insensate fury clearing the
highways of all save belated labourers and &#8217;ricksha
boys. Along the Chinese Bund the sampans
huddled even more closely together, and rocked
and creaked and complained. The inscrutable
countenance of the average Chinaman is the result
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
of five thousand years of misery. It was a night
for hand warmers&mdash;little jigsawed brass receptacles
filled with smoldering punk or charcoal,
which you carried in your sleeves and hugged if you
happened to be a Chinaman, as Ling Foo was.</p>
<p>He was a merchant. He sold furs, curios, table
linen, embroideries. His shop was out on the
Woosung Road. He did not sit on his stool or in
his alcove and wait for customers. He made packs
of his merchandise and canvassed the hotels in
the morning, from floor to floor, from room to
room. His curios, however, he left in the shop.
That was his lure to bring his hotel customers
round in the afternoon, when there were generally
additional profits and no commissions. This, of
course, had been the <i>modus operandi</i> in the happy
days before 1914, when white men began the
slaughter of white men. Nowadays Ling Foo was
off to the Astor House the moment he had news of
a ship dropping anchor off the bar twelve miles
down the Whangpoo River. The hour no longer
mattered; the point was to beat his competitors to
the market&mdash;and often there was no market.</p>
<p>He did not call the white people foreign devils;
he called them customers. That they worshipped
a bearded Buddha was no concern of his. Born in
the modern town, having spent twelve years in
San Francisco, he was not heavily barnacled with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
tradition. He was shrewd, a suave bargainer, and
as honest as the day is long. His English was
fluent.</p>
<p>To-night he was angry with the fates. The ship
was hours late. Moreover, it was a British transport,
dropping down from Vladivostok. He would
be wasting his time to wait for such passengers as
came ashore. They would be tired and hungry
and uncomfortable. So at seven o&#8217;clock he lit a
piece of punk, dropped it into his hand warmer,
threw his pack over his shoulders, and left the
cheery lobby of the hotel where he had been waiting
since five in the afternoon. He would be cold
and wet and hungry when he reached his shop.</p>
<p>Outside he called to a disconsolate &#8217;ricksha boy,
and a moment later rattled across the bridge that
spans the Soochow Creek. Even the Sikh policeman
had taken to cover. When he finally arrived
home he was drenched from his cap button to the
wooden soles of his shoes. He unlocked the shop
door, entered, flung the pack on the floor, and
turned on the electric light. Twenty minutes
later he was in dry clothes; hot rice, bean curd, and
tea were warming him; and he sat cross-legged in a
little alcove behind his till, smoking his metal pipe.
Two or three puffs, then he would empty the ash
in a brass bowl. He repeated this action half a
dozen times. He was emptying the ash for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
last time when the door opened violently and a
man lurched in, hatless and apparently drunk&mdash;a
white man.</p>
<p>But instantly Ling Foo saw that the man was
not drunk. Blood was streaming down his face,
which was gray with terror and agony. The man
made a desperate effort to save himself from falling,
and dragged a pile of embroidered jackets to
the floor as he went down.</p>
<p>Ling Foo did not stir. It was not possible for
him to move. The suddenness of the spectacle
had disconnected thought from action. He saw
all this, memorized it, even speculated upon it; but
he could not move.</p>
<p>The door was still open. The rain slanted
across the black oblong space. He saw it strike
the windows, pause, then trickle down. He could
not see what had become of the man; the counter
intervened. A tingle ran through Ling Foo&#8217;s
body, and he knew that his brain had gained control
of his body again. But before this brain could
telegraph to his legs three men rushed into the
shop. A bubble of sound came into Ling Foo&#8217;s
throat&mdash;one of those calls for help that fear
smothers.</p>
<p>The three men disappeared instantly below the
counter rim. Silence, except for the voices of the
rain and the wind. Ling Foo, tensely, even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
painfully alive now, waited. He was afraid, and it was
perfectly logical fear. Perhaps they had not
noticed him in the alcove. So he waited for this
fantastic drama to end.</p>
<p>The three men rose in unison. Ling Foo saw
that they were carrying the fourth between them.
The <ins class="trnote" title="&#8220;men&#8221; in original">man</ins> who carried the head and shoulders of the
victim&mdash;for Ling Foo was now certain that murder
was abroad&mdash;limped oddly, with a heave and
a sluing twist. Ling Foo slid off his cushion and
stepped round the counter in time to see the night
absorb the back of the man who limped. He
tried to recall the face of the man, but could not.
His initial terror had drawn for him three white
patches where faces should have been.</p>
<p>For several minutes Ling Foo stared at the oblong
blackness; then with a hysterical gurgle he ran
to the door, slammed and bolted it, and leaned
against the jamb, sick and faint, yet oddly relieved.
He would not now have to account to the
police for the body of an unknown white man.</p>
<p>A queer business. Nothing exciting ever happened
along this part of Woosung Road. What he
had witnessed&mdash;it still wasn&#8217;t quite believable&mdash;belonged
to the water front. Things happened
there, for these white sailors were a wild lot.</p>
<p>When the vertigo went out of his legs, Ling Foo
cat-stepped over to the scattered embroidered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
jackets and began mechanically to replace them on
the counter&mdash;all but two, for these were speckled
with blood. He contemplated them for a space,
and at last picked them up daintily and tossed
them into a far corner. When the blood dried he
would wash them out himself.</p>
<p>But there was that darkening stain on the floor.
That would have to be washed out at once or it
would be crying up to him eternally and recasting
the tragic picture. So he entered the rear of the
shop and summoned his wife. Meekly she obeyed
his order and scrubbed the stain. Her beady little
black eyes were so tightly lodged in her head that
it was not possible for her to elevate her brows in
surprise. But she knew that this stain was blood.</p>
<p>Ling Foo solemnly waved her aside when the
task was done, and she slip-slapped into the household
dungeon out of which she had emerged.</p>
<p>Her lord and master returned to his alcove. Ah,
but the pipe was good! He rocked slightly as he
smoked. Three pipefuls were reduced to ashes;
then he wriggled off the cushion, picked up his cash
counter and began slithering the buttons back and
forth; not because there were any profits or losses
that day, but because it gave a welcome turn to his
thoughts.</p>
<p>The storm raged outside. Occasionally he felt
the floor shudder. The windows ran thickly with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
rain. The door rattled. It was as if all objects
inanimate were demanding freedom from bolts and
nails. With the tip of his long, slender finger Ling
Foo moved the buttons. He counted what his
profits would be in Manchurian sables; in the two
Ming vases that had come in mysteriously from
Kiao-chau&mdash;German loot from Peking; counted his
former profits in snuff bottles, and so on.</p>
<p>The door rattled furiously.</p>
<p>Ling Foo could consider himself as tolerably
wealthy. Some day, when this great turmoil
among the whites subsided, he would move to
South China and grow little red oranges and
melons, and there would be a nook in the gardens
where he could sit with the perfume of jasmine
swimming over and about his head and the goodly
Book of Confucius on his knees.</p>
<p>A thudding sound&mdash;that wasn&#8217;t the wind. Ling
Foo looked over his buttons. He saw a human
face outside the door; a beautiful boy&#8217;s face&mdash;white.
That was the first impression. But as he
stared he saw a man&#8217;s fury destroy the boyish
stamp&mdash;gestures that demanded admission.</p>
<p>But Ling Foo shook his head with equal emphasis.
He would not go near that door again this
night.</p>
<p>The man outside shook his fists threateningly,
wheeled, and strode off. Three strides took him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
out of sight; but Ling Foo, with a damp little
chill on his spine, remarked that the visitor limped.</p>
<p>So! This would be the man who had carried
the bloody head and shoulders of the unknown.</p>
<p>Oriental curiosity blazed up and over Ling Foo&#8217;s
distaste. What was it all about? Why had the
limping man returned and demanded entrance?
What had they done with the body? Pearls! The
thought struck him as a blow. He began to
understand something of the episode. Pearls!
The beaten man had heard that sometimes Ling
Foo of Woosung Road dealt in pearls without being
overcurious. A falling out among thieves, and
one had tried to betray his confederates, paying
grimly for it. Pearls!</p>
<p>He trotted down to the door and peered into the
night, but he could see nothing. He wished now
that he had purchased those window curtains such
as the white merchants used over on the Bund.
Every move he made could be seen from across the
way, and the man who limped might be lurking
there, watching.</p>
<p>The man had come to him with pearls, but he
had not been quick enough. What had he done
with them? The man with the slue-foot would
not have returned had he found the pearls on his
moribund partner. That was sound reasoning.
Ling Foo&#8217;s heart contracted, then expanded and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
began to beat like a bird&#8217;s wing. In here somewhere&mdash;on
the floor!</p>
<p>He turned away from the door without haste.
His Oriental mind worked quickly and smoothly.
He would tramp back and forth the length of the
shop as if musing, but neither nook nor crevice
should escape his eye. He was heir to these pearls.
Slue-Foot&mdash;for so Ling Foo named his visitor&mdash;would
not dare molest him, since he, Ling Foo,
could go to the authorities and state that murder
had been done. Those tiger eyes in a boy&#8217;s face!
His spine grew cold.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he set about his game. With his
hands in his sleeves, his chin down, he paced the
passage between the two counters. As he turned
for the fifth journey a red-and-blue flash struck his
eye. The flash came from the far corner of the
shop, from the foot of the gunpowder-blue temple
vase. Diamonds&mdash;not pearls but diamonds!
Russian loot!</p>
<p>Ling Foo pressed down his excitement and
slowly approached the vase. A necklace! He
gave the object a slight kick, which sent it rattling
toward the door to the rear. He resumed his
pacing. Each time he reached the necklace he
gave it another kick. At length the necklace was
at the threshold. Ling Foo approached the light
and shut it off. Next he opened the door and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
kicked the necklace across the threshold. Diamonds&mdash;thirty
or forty of them on a string.</p>
<p>The room in the rear was divided into workshop
and storeroom. The living rooms were above.
His wife was squatted on the floor in an unlittered
corner mending a ceremonial robe of his. She was
always in this room at night when Ling Foo was
in the shop.</p>
<p>He ignored her and carried his prize to a lapidary&#8217;s
bench. He perched himself on a stool and
reached for his magnifying glass. A queer little
hiss broke through his lips. Cut-glass beads,
patently Occidental, and here in Shanghai practically
worthless!</p>
<p>In his passion of disappointment he executed a
gesture as if to hurl the beads to the floor, but let
his arm sink slowly. He had made a mistake.
These beads had not brought tragedy in and out
of his shop. Somehow he had missed the object;
some nook or corner had escaped him. In the
morning he would examine every inch of the floor.
White men did not kill each other for a string of
glass beads.</p>
<p>He stirred the beads about on his palm, and
presently swung them under the droplight. Beautifully
cut, small and large beads alternating, and
on the smaller a graven letter he could not decipher.
He observed some dark specks, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
scrutinized them under the magnifying glass.
Blood! His Oriental mind groped hopelessly.
Blood! He could make nothing of it. A murderous
quarrel over such as these!</p>
<p>For a long time Ling Foo sat on his stool, the
image of Buddha contemplating the way. Outside
the storm carried on vigorously, sending
rattles into casements and shudders into doors.
The wifely needle, a thread of silver fire, shuttled
back and forth in the heavy brocade silk.</p>
<p>Glass beads! Trumpery! Ling Foo slid off
the stool and shuffled back into the shop for his
metal pipe.</p>
<p>Having pushed Ling Foo into this blind alley,
out of which he was shortly to emerge, none the
wiser, the Pagan Madonna swooped down upon
the young woman with the ruddy hair and touched
her with the impelling finger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p>It was chance that brought Jane Norman into
Shanghai. The British transport, bound from
Vladivostok to Hong-Kong, was destined to
swing on her mudhook forty-eight hours. So
Jane, a Red Cross nurse, relieved and on the first
leg of the journey home to the United States, decided
to spend those forty-eight hours in Shanghai,
see the sights and do a little shopping. Besides,
she had seen nothing of China. On the way over,
fourteen months since, she had come direct from
San Francisco to the Russian port.</p>
<p>Jane was one of those suffocating adventurers
whom circumstance had fenced in. In fancy she
beat her hands against the bars of this cage that
had no door, but through which she could see the
caravans of dreams. Sea room and sky room were
the want of her, and no matter which way she
turned&mdash;bars. Her soul craved colour, distances,
mountain peaks; and about all she had ever seen
were the white walls of hospital wards. It is not
adventure to tend the sick, to bind up wounds, to
cheer the convalescing; it is a dull if angelic business.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>In her heart of hearts Jane knew that she had
accepted the hardships of the Siberian campaign
with the secret hope that some adventure might
befall her&mdash;only to learn that her inexorable cage
had travelled along with her. Understand, this
longing was not the outcome of romantical reading;
it was in the marrow of her&mdash;inherent. She was
not in search of Prince Charming. She rarely
thought of love as other young women think of it.
She had not written in her mind any particular
event she wanted to happen; but she knew that
there must be colour, distance, mountain peaks.
A few days of tremendous excitement; and then
she acknowledged that she would be quite ready
to return to the old monotonous orbit.</p>
<p>The Great War to Jane had not been romance
and adventure; her imagination, lively enough in
other directions, had not falsely coloured the
stupendous crime. She had accepted it instantly
for what it was&mdash;pain, horror, death, hunger, and
pestilence. She saw it as the genius of Vasili
Vereshchagin and Émile Zola had seen it.</p>
<p>The pioneer&mdash;after all, what was it he was truly
seeking? Freedom! And as soon as ever civilization
caught up with him he moved on. Without
understanding it, that was really all Jane wanted&mdash;freedom.
Freedom from genteel poverty, freedom
from the white walls of hospitals, freedom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
from exactly measured hours. Twenty four hours
a day, all her own; that was what she wanted;
twenty-four hours a day to do with as she pleased&mdash;to
sleep in, play, laugh, sing, love in. Pioneers,
explorers, adventurers&mdash;what else do they seek?
Twenty-four hours a day, all their own!</p>
<p>At half after eight&mdash;about the time Ling Foo
slid off his stool&mdash;the tender from the transport
sloshed up to the customs jetty and landed Jane, a
lone woman among a score of officers of various
nationalities. But it really wasn&#8217;t the customs
jetty her foot touched; it was the outer rim of the
whirligig.</p>
<p>Some officer had found an extra slicker for her
and an umbrella. Possibly the officer in olive drab
who assisted her to the nearest covered &#8217;ricksha and
directed the placement of her luggage.</p>
<p>&#8220;China!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. Mandarin coats and oranges,
jade and jasmine, Pekingese and red chow dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean that kind!&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;I should think these poor &#8217;ricksha boys would die
of exposure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Manchus are the toughest human beings on
earth. I&#8217;ll see you in the morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;upon the sun.
If it rains I shall lie abed all day. A real bed!
Honour bright, I&#8217;ve often wondered if I should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
ever see one again. Fourteen months in that awful
world up there! Siberia!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a plucky woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody had to go. Armenia or Siberia, it
was all the same to me if I could help.&#8221; She held
out her hand. &#8220;Good-night, captain. Thank
you for all your kindness to me. Ten o&#8217;clock, if it is
sunshiny. You&#8217;re to show me the shops. Oh, if
I were only rich!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what would you do if you had riches?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d buy all the silk at Kai Fook&#8217;s&mdash;isn&#8217;t that
the name?&mdash;and roll myself up in it like a cocoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed. He understood. A touch
of luxury, after all these indescribable months of
dirt and disease, rain and snow and ice, among a
people who lived like animals, who had the intelligence
of animals. When he spoke the officer&#8217;s
voice was singularly grave:</p>
<p>&#8220;These few days have been very happy ones for
me. At ten&mdash;if the sun shines. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8217;rickshas in a wavering line began to roll
along the Bund, which was practically deserted.
The lights shone through slanting lattices of rain.
Twice automobiles shot past, and Jane resented
them. China, the flowery kingdom! She was
touched with a little thrill of exultation. But oh,
to get home, home! Never again would she long
for palaces and servants and all that. The little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
wooden-frame house and the garden would be
paradise enough. The crimson ramblers, the
hollyhocks, the bachelor&#8217;s-buttons, and the peonies,
the twisted apple tree that never bore more than
enough for one pie! Her throat tightened.</p>
<p>She hadn&#8217;t heard from the mother in two
months, but there would be mail at Hong-Kong.
Letters and papers from home! Soon she would be
in the sitting room recounting her experiences; and
the little mother would listen politely, even doubtfully,
but very glad to have her back. How odd it
was! In the mother the spirit of adventure never
reached beyond the garden gate, while in the
daughter it had always been keen for the far
places. And in her first adventure beyond the
gate, how outrageously she had been cheated!
She had stepped out of drab and dreary routine
only to enter a drabber and drearier one.</p>
<p>What a dear boy this American officer was! He
seemed to have been everywhere, up and down the
world. He had hunted the white orchid of Borneo;
he had gone pearl hunting in the South Seas; and
he knew Monte Carlo, London, Paris, Naples,
Cairo. But he never spoke of home. She had
cleverly led up to it many times in the past month,
but always he had unembarrassedly switched the
conversation into another channel.</p>
<p>This puzzled her deeply. From the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Americans she never heard of anything but home,
and they were all mad to get there. Yet Captain
Dennison maintained absolute silence on that
topic. Clean shaven, bronzed, tall, and solidly
built, clear-eyed, not exactly handsome but engaging&mdash;what
lay back of the man&#8217;s peculiar
reticence? Being a daughter of Eve, the mystery
intrigued her profoundly.</p>
<p>Had he been a professional sailor prior to the
war? It seemed to her if that had been the case
he would have enlisted in the Navy. He talked
like a man who had spent many years on the
water; but in labour or in pleasure, he made it
most difficult for her to tell. Of his people, of his
past, not Bluebeard&#8217;s closet was more firmly shut.
Still with a little smile she recalled that eventually
a woman had opened that closet door, and hadn&#8217;t
had her head cut off, either.</p>
<p>He was poor like herself. That much was
established. For he had said frankly that when
he received his discharge from the Army he would
have to dig up a job to get a meal ticket.</p>
<p>Dear, dear! Would she ever see a continuous
stretch of sunshine again? How this rain tore into
things! Shanghai! Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to have a
thousand dollars to fling away on the shops? She
wanted jade beads, silks&mdash;not the quality the
Chinese made for export, but that heavy, shiver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
stuff that was as strong and shielding as wool&mdash;ivory
carvings, little bronze Buddhas with prayer
scrolls inside of them, embroidered jackets. But
why go on? She had less than a hundred, and she
would have to carry home gimcracks instead of
curios.</p>
<p>They were bobbing over a bridge now, and a
little way beyond she saw the lighted windows of
the great caravansary, the Astor House. It
smacked of old New York, where in a few weeks
she would be stepping back into the dull routine of
hospital work.</p>
<p>She paid the ricksha boy and ran into the lobby,
stamping her feet and shaking the umbrella. The
slicker was an overhead affair, and she had to take
off her hat to get free. This act tumbled her hair
about considerably, and Jane Norman&#8217;s hair was
her glory. It was the tint of the copper beech,
thick, finespun, with intermittent twists that gave
it a wavy effect.</p>
<p>Jane was not beautiful; that is, her face was
not&mdash;it was comely. It was her hair that turned
male heads. It was then men took note of her
body. She was magnificently healthy, and true
health is a magnet as powerful as that of the true
pole. It drew toward her men and women and
children. Her eyes were gray and serious; her
teeth were white and sound. She was twenty-four.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>There was, besides her hair, another thing that
was beautiful&mdash;her voice. It answered like the G
string of an old Strad to every emotion. One
could tell instantly when she was merry or sad or
serious or angry. She could not hide her emotions
any more than she could hide her hair. As a war
nurse she had been adored by the wounded men
and fought over by the hospital commandants.
But few men had dared make love to her. She
had that peculiar gift of drawing and repelling
without consciousness.</p>
<p>As the Chinese boy got her things together Jane
espied the bookstall. American newspapers and
American magazines! She packed four or five of
each under her arm, nodded to the boy, and followed
the manager to the lift! She hoped the
lights would hang so that she could lie in bed and
read. Her brain was thirsty for a bit of romance.</p>
<p>Humming, she unpacked. She had brought
one evening gown, hoping she might have a chance
to wear it before it fell apart from disuse. She
shook out the wrinkles and hung the gown in the
closet. Lavender! She raised a fold of the gown
and breathed in rapturously that homy perfume.
She sighed. Perhaps she would have to lay away
all her dreams in lavender.</p>
<p>A little later she sat before the dressing mirror,
combing her hair. How it happened she never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
could tell, but she heard a crash upon the wood
floor, and discovered her hand mirror shattered
into a thousand splinters.</p>
<p>Seven years&#8217; bad luck! She laughed. Fate
had blundered. The mirror had fallen seven
years too late.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p>Outside the bar where the Whangpoo
empties into the Yang-tse lay the thousand-ton
yacht <i>Wanderer II</i>, out of New
York. She was a sea whippet, and prior to the
war her bowsprit had nosed into all the famed
harbours of the seven seas. For nearly three years
she had been in the auxiliary fleet of the United
States Navy. She was still in war paint, owner&#8217;s
choice, but all naval markings had been obliterated.
Her deck was flush. The house, pierced by the
main companionway, was divided into three
sections&mdash;a small lounging room, a wireless room,
and the captain&#8217;s cabin, over which stood the
bridge and chart house. The single funnel rose
between the captain&#8217;s cabin and the wireless
room, and had the rakish tilt of the racer. <i>Wanderer
II</i> could upon occasion hit it up round twenty-one
knots, for all her fifteen years. There was
plenty of deck room fore and aft.</p>
<p>The crew&#8217;s quarters were up in the forepeak.
A passage-way divided the cook&#8217;s galley and the
dry stores, then came the dining salon. The main
salon, with a fine library, came next. The port
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
side of this salon was cut off into the owner&#8217;s
cabin. The main companionway dropped into
the salon, a passage each side giving into the guest
cabins. But rarely these days were there any
guests on <i>Wanderer II</i>.</p>
<p>The rain slashed her deck, drummed on the boat
canvas, and blurred the ports. The deck house
shed webby sheets of water, now to port, now to
starboard. The ladder was down, and a reflector
over the platform advertised the fact that either
the owner had gone into Shanghai or was expecting
a visitor.</p>
<p>All about were rocking lights, yellow and green
and red, from warships, tramps, passenger ships,
freighters, barges, junks. The water was streaked
with shaking lances of colour.</p>
<p>In the salon, under a reading lamp, sat a man
whose iron-gray hair was patched with cowlicks.
Combs and brushes produced no results, so the
owner had had it clipped to a short pompadour.
It was the skull of a fighting man, for all that
frontally it was marked by a high intellectuality.
This sort of head generally gives the possessor
yachts like <i>Wanderer II</i>, tremendous bank accounts;
the type that will always possess these
things, despite the howl of the proletariat.</p>
<p>The face was sunburned. There was some
loose flesh under the jaws. The nose was thick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
and pudgy, wide in the nostrils, like a lion&#8217;s. The
predatory are not invariably hawk-nosed. The
eyes were blue&mdash;in repose, a warm blue&mdash;and there
were feathery wrinkles at the corners which suggested
that the toll-taker could laugh occasionally.
The lips were straight and thin, the chin square&mdash;stubborn
rather than relentless. A lonely man
who was rarely lonesome.</p>
<p>His body was big. One has to be keen physically
as well as mentally to make a real success of anything.
His score might have tallied sixty. He
was at the peak of life, but hanging there, you
might say. To-morrow Anthony Cleigh might
begin the quick downward journey.</p>
<p>He had made his money in mines, rails, ships;
and now he was spending it prodigally. Prodigally,
yes, but with caution and foresight. There
was always a ready market for what he bought.
If he paid a hundred thousand for a Rembrandt,
rest assured he knew where he could dispose of
it for the same amount. Cleigh was a collector by
instinct. With him it was no fad; it was a passion,
sometimes absurd. This artistic love of rare and
beautiful creations was innate, not acquired.
Dealers had long since learned their lesson, and no
more sought to impose upon him.</p>
<p>He was not always scrupulous. In the dollar
war he had been sternly honest, harshly just. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
pursuit of objects of art he argued with his conscience
that he was not injuring the future of
widows and orphans when he bought some purloined
masterpiece. Without being in the least
aware of it, he was now the victim, not the master,
of the passion. He would have purchased
Raphael&#8217;s Adoration of the Magi had some rogue
been able to steal it from the Vatican.</p>
<p>Hanging from the ceiling and almost touching
the floor, forward between the entrance to the
dining salon and the owner&#8217;s cabin, was a rug
eight and a half by six. It was the first object
that struck your eye as you came down the
companionway. It was an animal rug, a museum
piece; rubies and sapphires and emeralds and
topaz melted into wool. It was under glass to
fend off the sea damp. Fit to hang beside the
Ardebil Carpet.</p>
<p>You never saw the rug except in this salon.
Cleigh dared not hang it in his gallery at home
in New York for the particular reason that the
British Government, urged by the Viceroy of
India, had been hunting high and low for the rug
since 1911, when it had been the rightful property
of a certain influential maharaja whose <i>Ai, ai!</i> had
reverberated from Hind to Albion over the loss.
Thus it will not be difficult to understand why
Cleigh was lonely rather than lonesome.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Queer lot. To be a true collector is to be as the
opium eater: you keep getting in deeper and
deeper, careless that the way back closes. After
a while you cannot feel any kick in the stuff you
find in the open marts, so you step outside the
pale, where they sell the unadulterated. That&#8217;s
the true, dyed-in-the-wool collector. He no longer
acquires a Vandyke merely to show to his friends;
that he possesses it for his own delectation is
enough. He becomes brother to Gaspard, miser;
and like Gaspard he cannot be fooled by spurious
gold.</p>
<p>Over the top of the rug was a curtain of waxed
sailcloth that could be dropped by the pull of a
cord, and it was generally dropped whenever
Cleigh made port.</p>
<p>It was vaguely known that Cleigh possessed the
maharaja&#8217;s treasure. Millionaire collectors, agents,
and famous salesroom auctioneers had heard indirectly;
but they kept the information to themselves&mdash;not
from any kindly spirit, however.
Never a one of them but hoped some day he might
lay hands upon the rug and dispose of it to some
other madman. A rug valued at seventy thousand
dollars was worth a high adventure. Cleigh,
however, with cynical humour courted the danger.</p>
<p>There is a race of hardy dare-devils&mdash;super-thieves&mdash;of
which the world hears little and knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
little. These adventurers have actually robbed
the Louvre, the Vatican, the Pitti Gallery, the
palaces of kings and sultans. It was not so long
ago that La Gioconda&mdash;Mona Lisa&mdash;was stolen
from the Louvre. Cleigh had come from New
York, thousands of miles, for the express purpose
of meeting one of these amazing rogues&mdash;a rogue
who, had he found a rich wallet on the pavements,
would have moved heaven and earth to find the
owner, but who would have stolen the Pope&#8217;s
throne had it been left about carelessly.</p>
<p>It is rather difficult to analyze the moral status
of such a man, or that of the man ready to deal
with him.</p>
<p>Cleigh lowered his book and assumed a listening
attitude. Above the patter of the rain he heard
the putt-putt of a motor launch. He laid the book
on the table and reached for a black cigar, which
he lit and began to puff quickly. Louder grew
the panting of the motor. It stopped abruptly.
Cleigh heard a call or two, then the creaking of the
ladder. Two minutes later a man limped into
the salon. He tossed his sou&#8217;wester to the floor
and followed it with the smelly oilskin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Cleigh! Devil of a night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a peg?&#8221; asked Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never touch the stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; I had forgotten.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>Cleigh never looked upon this man&#8217;s face without
recalling del Sarto&#8217;s John the Baptist&mdash;supposing
John had reached forty by the way of reckless
passions. The extraordinary beauty was still
there, but as though behind a blurred pane of
glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Cleigh, trying to keep the eagerness
out of his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the devil to pay&mdash;all in a half hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got it?&#8221; Cleigh blazed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morrissy&mdash;one of the squarest chaps in the
world&mdash;ran amuck the last minute. Tried to
double-cross me, and in the rough-and-tumble
that followed he was more or less banged up. We
hurried him to a hospital, where he lies unconscious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the beads!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either he dropped them in the gutter, or they
repose on the floor of a Chinese shop in Woosung
Road. I&#8217;ll be there bright and early&mdash;never you
fear. Don&#8217;t know what got into Morrissy. Of
course I&#8217;ll look him up in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousands of miles&mdash;to hear a yarn like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleigh, we&#8217;ve done business for nearly twenty
years. You can&#8217;t point out an instance where I
ever broke my word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; grumbled Cleigh. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve gone
to all this trouble, getting a crew and all that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
And now you tell me you&#8217;ve let the beads slip
through your fingers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! You&#8217;d have put the yacht into commission
if you&#8217;d never heard from me. You were
crazy to get to sea again. Any trouble picking
up the crew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But only four of the old crew&mdash;Captain
Newton, of course, and Chief Engineer Svenson,
Donaldson, and Morley. Still, it&#8217;s the best crew I
ever had: young fellows off warships and transports,
looking for comfortable berths and a little
adventure that won&#8217;t entail hunting periscopes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of coal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust me for that. Four hundred tons in
Manila, and I shan&#8217;t need more than a bucketful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who drew the plans for this yacht?&#8221; asked
Cunningham, with a roving glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Why didn&#8217;t you leave the job to
someone who knew how? It&#8217;s a series of labyrinths
on this deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted a big main salon, even if I had to
sacrifice some of the rest of the space. Besides, it
keeps the crew out of sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I should say out of touch, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite satisfied,&#8221; replied Cleigh, grumpily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleigh, I&#8217;m through.&#8221; Cunningham spread
his hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you through with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through with this game. I&#8217;m going in for a
little sport. This string of beads was the wind-up.
But don&#8217;t worry. They&#8217;ll be on board here to-morrow.
You brought the gold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitor paused in front of the rug. He
sighed audibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scheherazade&#8217;s twinkling little feet! Lord,
but that rug is a wonder! Cleigh, I&#8217;ve been offered
eighty thousand for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Cleigh barked, half out of his
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty thousand by Eisenfeldt. I don&#8217;t know
what crazy fool he&#8217;s dealing for, but he offers me
eighty thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh got up and pressed a wall button. Presently
a man stepped into the salon from the starboard
passage. He was lank, with a lean, wind-bitten
face and a hard blue eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dodge,&#8221; announced Cleigh, smiling, &#8220;this is
Mr. Cunningham. I want you to remember him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dodge agreed with a curt nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;If ever you see him in this cabin when I&#8217;m
absent, you know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Dodge, with a wintry smile.</p>
<p>Cunningham laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you carry a Texas gunman round with you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
now? After all, why not? You never can tell.
But don&#8217;t worry, Cleigh. If ever I make up my
mind to accept Eisenfeldt&#8217;s offer, I&#8217;ll lift the yacht
first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh laughed amusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you go about to steal a yacht like
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s telling. Now I&#8217;ve got to get back to
town. My advice for you is to come in to-morrow
and put up at the Astor, where I can get in touch
with you easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed. That&#8217;s all, Dodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Texan departed, and Cunningham burst
into laughter again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an interesting man, Cleigh. On my
word, you do need a guardian&mdash;gallivanting round
the world with all these treasures. Queer what
things we do when we try to forget. Is there any
desperate plunge we wouldn&#8217;t take if we thought
we could leave the Old Man of the Sea behind?
You think you&#8217;re forgetting when you fly across
half the world for a string of glass beads. I think
I&#8217;m forgetting when I risk my neck getting hold
of some half-forgotten Rembrandt. But there
it is, always at our shoulder when we turn. One
of the richest men in the world! Doesn&#8217;t that
tingle you when you hear people whisper it as you
pass? Just as I tingle when some woman gasps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
&#8216;What a beautiful face!&#8217; We both have our
withered leg&mdash;only yours is invisible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mockery on the face and the irony on the
tongue of the man disturbed Cleigh. Supposing
the rogue had his eye on that rug? To what
lengths might he not go to possess it? And he had
the infernal ingenuity of his master, Beelzebub.
Or was he just trying Anthony Cleigh&#8217;s nerves to
see whether they were sound or raw?</p>
<p>&#8220;But the beads!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Simply Morrissy ran amuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to pay half as much again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave that to me&mdash;at the original price.
No hold-up. Prices fixed, as the French say.
Those beads will be on board here to-morrow.
But why the devil do you carry that rug abroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To look at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad as a hatter!&#8221; Cunningham picked up
his oilskin and sou&#8217;wester. &#8220;Hang it, Cleigh, I&#8217;ve
a notion to have a try at that rug just for the sport
of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to bump into Dodge,&#8221; replied the
millionaire, dryly, &#8220;try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be the whole thing&mdash;the yacht&mdash;when
I start action! Devil take the weather!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How the deuce did the beads happen to turn
up here in Shanghai?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morrissy brought them east from Naples.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
That&#8217;s why his work to-night puzzles me. All
those weeks to play the crook in, and then to make
a play for it when he knew he could not put it
over! Brain storm&mdash;and when he comes to he&#8217;ll
probably be sorry. Well, keep your eye on the
yacht.&#8221; Cunningham shouldered into his oilskin.
&#8220;To-morrow at the Astor, between three and five.
By George, what a ripping idea&mdash;to steal the
yacht! I&#8217;m mad as a hatter, too. Good-night,
Cleigh.&#8221; And laughing, Cunningham went twisting
up the companionway, into the rain and the
dark.</p>
<p>Cleigh stood perfectly still until the laughter
became an echo and the echo a memory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p>Morning and winnowed skies; China
awake. The great black-and-gold banners
were again fluttering in Nanking
Road. Mongolian ponies clattered about, automobiles
rumbled, &#8217;rickshas jogged. Venders were
everywhere, many with hot rice and bean curd.
Street cleaners in bright-red cotton jackets were
busy with the mud puddles. The river swarmed
with sampans and barges and launches. There
was only one lifeless thing in all Shanghai that
morning&mdash;the German Club.</p>
<p>In the city hospital the man Morrissy, his head
in bandages, smiled feebly into Cunningham&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you mad to try a game like that? What
the devil possessed you? Three to one, and never
a ghost of a chance. You never blew up like this
before. What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just struck me, Dick&mdash;one of those impulses
you can&#8217;t help. I&#8217;m sorry. Ought to have known
I&#8217;d have no chance, and you&#8217;d have been justified
in croaking me. Just as I was in the act of
handing them over to you the idea came to bolt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
All that dough would keep me comfortably the
rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. After that biff on the coco I only
wanted some place to crawl into. I had them in
my hand when I started to run. Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they quizzed you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I made out I couldn&#8217;t talk. What&#8217;s
the dope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were in a rough-and-tumble down the
Chinese Bund, and we got you away. Play up to
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. But, gee! I won&#8217;t be able to go
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we have any luck, I&#8217;ll see you get a
share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s white. You were always a white man,
Dick. I feel like a skunk. I knew I couldn&#8217;t put
it over, with the three of you at my elbow. What
the devil got into me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any funds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to get me down to Singapore. Where
do you want me to hang out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suit yourself. You&#8217;re out of this play&mdash;and
it&#8217;s my last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quitting the big game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What&#8217;s left of my schedule I&#8217;m going to
run out on my own. So we probably won&#8217;t meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
again for a long time, Morrissy. Here&#8217;s a couple
of hundred to add to your store. If we find the
beads I&#8217;ll send your share wherever you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might as well be Naples. They&#8217;re off me in
the States.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Cook&#8217;s or the American Express?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Address me the Milan direct.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Dick. I&#8217;m sorry I gummed it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as Cunningham passed from sight, the man
on the cot smiled ironically at the sun-splashed
ceiling. A narrow squeak, but he had come
through.</p>
<p>Cunningham, grateful for the sunshine, limped
off toward Woosung Road, grotesquely but incredibly
fast for a man with only one sound leg.
He never used a cane, having the odd fancy that a
stick would only emphasize his affliction. He
might have taken a &#8217;ricksha this morning, but he
never thought of it until he had crossed Soochow
Creek.</p>
<p>But Ling Foo was not in his shop and the door
was locked. Cunningham explored the muddy
gutters all the way from Ling Foo&#8217;s to Moy&#8217;s tea
house, where the meeting had taken place. He
found nothing, and went into Moy&#8217;s to wait. Ling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
Foo would have to pass the restaurant. A boy
who knew the merchant stood outside to watch.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Jane woke at nine. The brightness of the window
shade told her that the sun was clear. She
sprang out of bed, a trill of happiness in her throat.
The shops! Oh, the beautiful, beautiful shops!</p>
<p>&#8220;China, China, China!&#8221; she sang.</p>
<p>She threw up the shade and squinted for a moment.
The sun in the heavens and the reflection
on the Whangpoo were blinding. The sampans
made her think of ants, darting, scuttling, wheeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the beautiful shops!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all the things in the world&mdash;this side of the
world&mdash;worth having, nothing else seemed comparable
to jade&mdash;a jade necklace. Not the stone
that looked like dull marble with a greenish pallor&mdash;no.
She wanted the deep apple-green jade, the
royal, translucent stone. And she knew that she
had as much chance of possessing the real article
as she had of taking her pick of the scattered
Romanoff jewels.</p>
<p>Jane held to the belief that when you wished for
something you couldn&#8217;t have it was niggardly not
to wish magnificently.</p>
<p>She dressed hurriedly, hastened through her
breakfast of tea and toast and jam, and was about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
to sally forth upon the delectable adventure, when
there came a gentle knock on the door. She
opened it, rather expecting a boy to announce that
Captain Dennison was below. Outside stood a
Chinaman in a black skirt and a jacket of blue
brocade. He was smiling and kotowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would the lady like to see some things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said Jane, readily.</p>
<p>Ling Foo deposited his pack on the floor
and opened it. He had heard that a single
woman had come in the night before and,
shrewd merchant that he was, he had wasted no
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furs!&#8221; cried Jane, reaching down for the
Manchurian sable. She blew aside the top fur
and discovered the smoky down beneath. She
rubbed her cheek against it ecstatically. She
wondered what devil&#8217;s lure there was about furs
and precious stones that made women give up all
the world for them. Was that madness hidden
away in her somewhere?</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew beforehand that the answer would
render the question utterly futile.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred Mex,&#8221; said Ling Foo. &#8220;Very
cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred Mex?&#8221; That would be nearly
fifty dollars in American money. With a sigh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
she dropped the fur. &#8220;Too much for me. How
much is that Chinese jacket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty Mex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane carried it over to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you fifteen for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo was willing to forego his usual hundred
per cent. profit in order to start the day with a
sale. Then he spread out the grass linen.</p>
<p>Jane went into raptures over some of the designs,
but in the end she shook her head. She
wanted something from Shanghai, something from
Hong-Kong, something from Yokohama. If she
followed her inclination she would go broke here
and now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any jade? Understand, I&#8217;m not
buying. Just want to see some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, lady; but I can bring you some this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn you, I&#8217;m not buying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to show the lady. What time
shall I call?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, about tea time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo reached inside his jacket and produced
a string of cut-glass beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;How pretty! What are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane hooked the string round her neck and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
viewed the result in the mirror. The sunshine,
striking the facets, set fire to the beads. They
were really lovely. She took a sudden fancy to
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four Mex.&#8221; It was magnanimous of Ling
Foo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them.&#8221; They were real, anyhow.
&#8220;Bring your jade at tea time and call for Miss
Norman. I can&#8217;t give you any more time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo bundled up his assorted merchandise
and trotted away infinitely relieved. The whole
affair was off his hands. In no wise could the
police bother him now. He knew nothing; he
would know nothing until he met his honourable
ancestors.</p>
<p>From ten until three Jane, under the guidance
of Captain Dennison, stormed the shops on the
Bunds and Nanking Road; but in returning to the
Astor House she realized with dismay that she had
expended the major portion of her ammunition in
this offensive. She doubted if she would have
enough to buy a kimono in Japan. It was dreadful
to be poor and to have a taste for luxury and an
eye for beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; she said as they sat down to tea,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask one more favour.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Chinaman is coming with some jade. If
I&#8217;m alone with him I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll buy something,
and I really can&#8217;t spend another penny in Shanghai.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Want me to shoo him off in case his
persistence is too much for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. It&#8217;s very nice of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Greatest pleasure in the world. I wish the
job was permanent&mdash;shooing &#8217;em away from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sent him a quick sidelong glance, but he was
smiling. Still, there was something in the tone
that quickened her pulse. All nonsense, of course;
both of them stony, as the Britishers put it; both
of them returning to the States for bread and
butter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you put up here?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;There is plenty of room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I thought perhaps it would be better if I
stayed at the Palace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! Who cares?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221; And this time he did not smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose my Chinaman will be waiting in the
lobby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s toddle along, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison followed her out of the tea room, his
gaze focused on the back of her neck, and it was
just possible to resist the mad inclination to bend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
and kiss the smooth, ivory-tinted skin. He was
not ready to analyze the impulse for fear he might
find how deep down the propellant was. A woman,
young in the heart, young in the body, and old in
the mind, disillusioned but not embittered, unafraid,
resourceful, sometimes beautiful and sometimes
plain, but always splendidly alive.</p>
<p>Perhaps the wisest move on his part was to avoid
her companionship, invent some excuse to return
by the way of Manila, pretend he had transfer
orders. To spend twenty-one days on the same
ship with her and to keep his head seemed a bit too
strong. Had there been something substantial
reaching down from the future&mdash;a dependable job&mdash;he
would have gone with her joyously. But he
had not a dollar beyond his accumulated pay; that
would melt quickly enough when he reached the
States. He was thirty; he would have to hustle to
get anywhere by the time he was forty. His only
hope was that back in the States they were calling
for men who knew how to manage men, and he had
just been discharged&mdash;or recalled for that purpose&mdash;from
the best school for that. But they were
calling for specialists, too, and he was a jack of all
trades and master of none.</p>
<p>He knew something about art, something about
music, something about languages; but he could
not write. He was a fair navigator, but not fair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
enough for a paying job. He could take an automobile
engine apart and reassemble it with skill,
but any chauffeur could do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better go into the parlour?&#8221; he
heard Jane asking as they passed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be alone there. It will be easier for you
to resist temptation, I suppose, if there isn&#8217;t any
audience. Audiences are nuisances. Men have
killed each other because they feared the crowd
might mistake common sense for the yellow
streak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the thought leaped into the girl&#8217;s
mind: Supposing such an event lay back of this
strange silence about his home and his people?
She recalled the ruthless ferocity with which he had
broken up a street fight between American and
Japanese soldiers one afternoon in Vladivostok.
Supposing he had killed someone? But she had to
repudiate this theory. No officer in the United
States Army could cover up anything like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the parlour,&#8221; she said to Ling Foo, who
was smiling and kotowing.</p>
<p>Ling Foo picked up his blackwood box. Inwardly
he was not at all pleased at the prospect of
having an outsider witness the little business
transaction he had in mind. Obliquely he studied
the bronze mask. There was no eagerness, no
curiosity, no indifference. It struck Ling Foo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
that there was something Oriental in this officer&#8217;s
repose. But five hundred gold! Five hundred
dollars in American gold&mdash;for a string of glass
beads!</p>
<p>He set the blackwood box on a stand, opened it,
and spread out jade earrings, rings, fobs, bracelets,
strings. The girl&#8217;s eagerness caused Ling Foo
to sigh with relief. It would be easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warned you that I should not buy anything,&#8221;
said Jane, ruefully. &#8220;But even if I had the money
I would not buy this kind of a jade necklace. I
should want apple-green.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Ling Foo, shocked with delight.
&#8220;Perhaps we can make a bargain. You have
those glass beads I sold you this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am wearing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane took off her mink-fur collaret, which was
sadly worn.</p>
<p>Ling Foo&#8217;s hand went into his box again. From
a piece of cotton cloth he drew forth a necklace
of apple-green jade, almost perfect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the lovely thing!&#8221; Jane seized the necklace.
&#8220;To possess something like this! Isn&#8217;t it
glorious, captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it.&#8221; Dennison inspected the necklace
carefully. &#8220;It is genuine. Where did you
get this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo shrugged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Long ago, during the Boxer troubles, I bought
it from a sailor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, probably loot from the Peking palace.
How much is it worth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Murder blazed up in Ling Foo&#8217;s heart, but his
face remained smilingly bland.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I can get for it. But if the lady wishes
I will give it to her in exchange for the glass beads.
I had no right to sell the beads,&#8221; Ling Foo went
on with a deprecating gesture. &#8220;I thought the
man who owned them would never claim them.
But he came this noon. Something belonging to
his ancestor&mdash;and he demands it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trade them? Good heavens, yes! Of all
things! Here!&#8221; Jane unclasped the beads and
thrust them toward Ling Foo&#8217;s eager claw.</p>
<p>But Dennison reached out an intervening hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment, Miss Norman. What&#8217;s the
game?&#8221; he asked of Ling Foo.</p>
<p>Ling Foo silently cursed all this meddler&#8217;s ancestors
from Noah down, but his face expressed
only mild bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Why didn&#8217;t you offer some other bits of
jade? This string is worth two or three hundred
gold; and this is patently a string of glass beads,
handsomely cut, but nevertheless plain glass.
What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I have explained!&#8221; protested Ling Foo.
&#8220;The string is not mine. I have in honour to return
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! That&#8217;s all very well. You could
have told this lady that and offered to return her
money. But a jade necklace like this one! No,
Miss Norman; my advice is to keep the beads until
we learn what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But to let that jade go!&#8221; she wailed comically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady may keep the jade until to-morrow.
She may have the night to decide. This is no
hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo saw that he had been witless indeed.
The thought of raising the bid of five hundred gold
to a thousand or more had bemused him, blunted
his ordinary cunning.</p>
<p>Inwardly he cursed his stupidity. But the appearance
of a witness to the transaction had set
him off his balance. The officer had spoken
shrewdly. The young woman would have returned
the beads in exchange for the sum she had
paid for them, and she would never have suspected&mdash;nor
the officer, either&mdash;that the beads possessed
unknown value. Still, the innocent covetousness,
plainly visible in her eyes, told him that the game
was not entirely played out; there was yet a dim
chance. Alone, without the officer to sway her,
she might be made to yield.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The lady may wear the beads to-night if she
wishes. I will return for them in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this does not explain the glass beads,&#8221;
said the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will bring the real owner with me in the
morning,&#8221; volunteered Ling Foo. &#8220;He sets a high
value on them through sentiment. Perhaps I was
hasty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison studied the glass beads. Perhaps his
suspicions were not on any too solid ground. Yet
a string of jade beads like that in exchange! Something
was in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, smiling at the appeal in the
girl&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose there will be any harm
in keeping them overnight. We&#8217;ll have a chance
to talk it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo&#8217;s plan of attack matured suddenly.
He would call near midnight. He would somehow
manage to get to her door. She would probably
hand him the glass beads without a word of argument.
Then he would play his game with the man
who limped. He smiled inwardly as he put his
wares back into the carved box. A thousand gold!
At any rate, he would press the man into a corner.
There was something about this affair that convinced
Ling Foo that his noon visitor would pay high
for two reasons: one, to recover the glass beads;
the other, to keep out of the reach of the police.

<p>Ling Foo considered that he was playing his
advantage honestly. He hadn&#8217;t robbed or murdered
anybody. A business deal had slipped into
his hands and it was only logical to make the most
of it. He kotowed several times on the way out
of the parlour, conscious, however, of the searching
eyes of the man who had balked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; exclaimed Jane. &#8220;What in the world
do you suppose is going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord knows, but something is going on. You
couldn&#8217;t buy a jade necklace like that under five
hundred in New York. This apple-green seldom
runs deep; the colour runs in veins and patches.
The bulk of the quarried stone has the colour and
greasy look of raw pork. No; I shouldn&#8217;t put it on
just now, not until you have washed it. You never
can tell. I&#8217;ll get you a germicide at the English
apothecary&#8217;s. Glass beads! Humph! Hanged if
I can make it out. Glass; Occidental, too; maybe
worth five dollars in the States. Put it on again.
It&#8217;s a great world over here. You&#8217;re always
stumbling into something unique. I&#8217;m coming
over to dine with you to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane put the jade into her hand-bag, clasped the
glass beads round her neck again, and together she
and Dennison walked toward the parlour door.
As they reached it a tall, vigorous, elderly man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
with a gray pompadour started to enter. He
paused, with an upward tilt of the chin, but the
tilt was the result of pure astonishment. Instinctively
Jane turned to her escort. His chin was
tilted, too, and his expression was a match for the
stranger&#8217;s. Later, recalling the tableau, which
lasted but a moment, it occurred to Jane that two
men, suddenly confronted by a bottomless pit,
might have expressed their dumfounderment in
exactly this fashion.</p>
<p>In the lobby she said rather breathlessly: &#8220;You
knew each other and didn&#8217;t speak! Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer threw her into a hypnotic state.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; said Dennison, quietly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p>Father and son! For a while Jane had
the sensation of walking upon unsubstantial
floors, of seeing unsubstantial objects.
The encounter did not seem real, human.
Father and son, and they had not rushed into each
other&#8217;s arms! No matter what had happened in
the past, there should have been some human sign
other than astonishment. At the very least two
or three years had separated them. Just stared
for a moment, and passed on!</p>
<p>Hypnotism is a fact; a word or a situation will
create this peculiar state of mind. Father and
son! The phrase actually hypnotized Jane, and
she remained in the clutch of it until hours later,
which may account for the amazing events into
which she permitted herself to be drawn. Father
and son! Her actions were normal; her mental
state was not observable; but inwardly she retained
no clear recollection of the hours that intervened
between this and the astonishing climax.
As from a distance, she heard the voice of the son:</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks rum to you, no doubt. But I can&#8217;t tell
you the story&mdash;at least not now. It&#8217;s the story of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
a tomfool. I had no idea he was on this side. I
haven&#8217;t laid eyes on him in seven years. Dinner
at seven. I&#8217;ll have that germicide sent up to your
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain nodded abruptly and made off
toward the entrance.</p>
<p>Jane understood. He wanted to be alone&mdash;to
catch his breath, as it were. At any rate, that
was a human sign that something besides astonishment
was stirring within. So she walked mechanically
over to the bookstall and hazily glanced at
the backs of the new novels, riffled the pages of
a magazine; and to this day she cannot recall
whether the clerk was a man or a woman, white or
brown or yellow, for a hand touched her sleeve
lightly, compelling her attention. Dennison&#8217;s
father stood beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but may I ask you a question?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane dropped the fur collaret in her confusion.
They both stooped for it, and collided gently; but
in rising the man glimpsed the string of glass beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jane, as she received the
collaret. &#8220;What is it you wish to ask of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The name of the man you were with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dennison; his own and yours&mdash;probably,&#8221; she
said with spirit, for she took sides in that moment,
and was positive that the blame for the estrangement
lay with the father. The level, unagitated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
voice irritated her; she resented it. He wasn&#8217;t
human!</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Cleigh&mdash;Anthony Cleigh. Thank
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh bowed politely and moved away. Behind
that calm, impenetrable mask, however, was
turmoil, kaleidoscopic, whirling too quickly for the
brain to grasp or hold definite shapes. The boy
here! And the girl with those beads round her
throat! For the subsidence of this turmoil it was
needful to have space; so Cleigh strode out of the
lobby into the fading day, made his way across
the bridge, and sought the Bund. He forgot all
about his appointment with Cunningham.</p>
<p>He lit a cigar and walked on and on, oblivious of
the cries of the &#8217;ricksha boys, importunate beggars,
the human currents that broke and flowed each
side of him. The boy here in Shanghai! And
that girl with those beads round her throat! It
was as though his head had become a tom-tom in
the hands of fate. The drumming made it impossible
to think clearly. It was the springing up
of the electric lights that brought him back to
actualities. He looked at his watch.</p>
<p>He had been tramping up and down the Bund
for two solid hours.</p>
<p>And now came, clearly defined, the idea for
which he had been searching. He indulged in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
series of rumbling chuckles. You will have heard
such a sound in the forest when a stream suddenly
takes on a merry mood&mdash;broken water.</p>
<p>To return to Jane, whom Cleigh had left in a
state of growing hypnosis. She was able to act
and think intelligently, but the spell lay like a fog
upon her will, enervating it. She grasped the
situation clearly enough; it was tremendous. She
had heard of Anthony Cleigh. Who in America
had not? Father and son, and they had passed
each other without a nod! Had she not been a
witness to the episode, she would not have believed
such a performance possible.</p>
<p>Through the fog burst a clear point of light.
This was not the first time she had encountered
Anthony Cleigh. Where had she seen him before,
and under what circumstance? Later, when she
was alone, she would dig into her storehouse of
recollection. Certainly she must bring back that
episode. One thing, she had not known him as
Anthony Cleigh.</p>
<p>Father and son, and they had not spoken! It
was this that beat persistently upon her mind.
What dramatic event had created such a condition?
After seven years! These two, strong
mentally and physically, in a private war! She
understood now how it was that Dennison had
been able to tell her about Monte Carlo, the South
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Sea Islands, Africa, Asia; he had been his father&#8217;s
companion on the yacht.</p>
<p>Mechanically she approached the lift. In her
room all her actions were more or less mechanical.
From the back of her mind somewhere came the
order to her hands. She took down the evening
gown. This time the subtle odour of lavender left
her untouched. To be beautiful, to wish that she
were beautiful! Why? Her hair was lovely; her
neck and arms were lovely; but her nose wasn&#8217;t
right, her mouth was too large, and her eyes missed
being either blue or hazel. Why did she wish to be
beautiful?</p>
<p>Always to be poor, to be hanging on the edge of
things, never enough of this or that&mdash;genteel
poverty. She had inherited the condition, as had
her mother before her&mdash;gentlefolk who had to
count the pennies. Her two sisters&mdash;really handsome
girls&mdash;had married fairly well; but one lived
in St. Louis and the other in Seattle, so she never
saw them any more.</p>
<p>Tired. That was it. Tired of the war for
existence; tired of the following odours of antiseptics;
tired of the white walls of hospitals, the
sight of pain. On top of all, the level dullness of
the past, the leaden horror of these months in
Siberia. She laughed brokenly. Gardens scattered
all over the world, and she couldn&#8217;t find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
one&mdash;the gardens of imagination! Romance everywhere,
and she never could touch any of it!</p>
<p>Marriage. Outside of books, what was it save
a legal contract to cook and bear children in exchange
for food and clothes? The humdrum!
She flung out her arms with a gesture of rage. She
had been cheated, as always. She had come to
this side of the world expecting colour, movement,
adventure. The Orient of the novels she had read&mdash;where
was it? Drab skies, drab people, drab
work! And now to return to America, to exchange
one drab job for another! Nadir, always
nadir, never any zenith!</p>
<p>Her bitter cogitations were interrupted by a
knock on the door. She threw on her kimono and
answered. A yellow hand thrust a bottle toward
her. It would be the wash for the jade. She
emptied the soap dish, cleaned it, poured in the
germicide, and dropped the jade necklace into the
liquid. She left it there while she dressed.</p>
<p>Dennison Cleigh, returning to the States to
look for a job! Nothing she had ever read seemed
quite so fantastic. She paused in her dressing to
stare at some inner thought which she projected
upon the starred curtain of the night beyond her
window. Supposing they had wanted to fling
themselves into each other&#8217;s arms and hadn&#8217;t
known how? She had had a glimpse or two of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Dennison&#8217;s fierce pride. Naturally he had inherited
it from his father. Supposing they were
just stupid rather than vengeful? Poor, foolish
human beings!</p>
<p>She proceeded with her toilet. Finishing that,
she cleansed the jade necklace with soap and
water, then realized that she would not be able to
wear it, because the string would be damp. So
she put on the glass beads instead&mdash;another move
by the Madonna of the Pagan. Jane Norman
was to have her fling.</p>
<p>Dennison was in the lobby waiting for her.
He gave a little gasp of delight as he beheld her.
Of whom and of what did she remind him? Somebody
he had seen, somebody he had read about?
For the present it escaped him. Was she handsome?
He could not say; but there was that in
her face that was always pulling his glance and
troubling him for the want of knowing why.</p>
<p>The way she carried herself among men had
always impressed him. Fearless and friendly,
and with deep understanding, she created respect
wherever she went. Men, toughened and coarsened
by danger and hardship, somehow understood
that Jane Norman was not the sort to make
love to because one happened to be bored. On the
other hand, there was something in her that called
to every man, as a candle calls to the moth; only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
there were no burnt wings; there seemed to be
some invisible barrier that kept the circling moths
beyond the zone of incineration.</p>
<p>Was there fire in her? He wondered. That
copper tint in her hair suggested it. Magnificent!
And what the deuce was the colour of her eyes?
Sometimes there was a glint of topaz, or cornflower
sapphire, gray agate; they were the most
tantalizing eyes he had ever gazed into.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hungry?&#8221; he greeted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;For fourteen months!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a year of my life for a club steak and
all the regular fixings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t fair! You&#8217;ve gone and spoiled my
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wishy-washy chicken! How I hate tin cans!
Pancakes and maple syrup! What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sliced tomatoes with sugar and vinegar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do! I don&#8217;t care how plebeian it is. Bread
and butter and sliced tomatoes with sugar and
vinegar&mdash;better than all the ice cream that ever
was! Childhood ambrosia! For mercy&#8217;s sake,
let&#8217;s get in before all the wings are gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered the huge dining room with its
pattering Chinese boys&mdash;entered it laughing&mdash;while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
all the time there was at bottom a single
identical thought&mdash;the father.</p>
<p>Would they see him again? Would he be here
at one of the tables? Would a break come, or
would the affair go on eternally?</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what it is!&#8221; he cried, breaking through
the spell.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever read &#8216;Phra the Ph&oelig;nician&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. But what is what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For days I&#8217;ve been trying to place you. You&#8217;re
the British heroine!&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought for a moment to recall the physical
attributes of this heroine.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not red-headed!&#8221; she denied, indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is! It is the most beautiful head of hair
I ever laid eyes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is the beginning and the end of me,&#8221;
she returned with a little catch in her voice.</p>
<p>The knowledge bore down upon her that her
soul was thirsty for this kind of talk. She did not
care whether he was in earnest or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beginning, but not the end of you. Your
eyes are fine, too. They keep me wondering all the
time what colour they really are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very nice of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the way you carry yourself!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as if you had come down from
Olympus and had lost the way back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, you&#8217;re a dear! I&#8217;ve just been wild
to have a man say foolish things to me.&#8221; She
knew that she might play with this man; that he
would never venture across the line. &#8220;Men have
said foolish things to me, but always when I was
too busy to bother. To-night I haven&#8217;t anything
in this wide world to do but listen. Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, perhaps a little ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any fire in you, I wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;&mdash;tantalizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I should like to see you in a rage.
I&#8217;ve been watching you for weeks, and have found
myself irritated by that perpetual calm of yours.
That day of the riot you stood on the curb as unconcerned
as though you had been witnessing a
movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that it is the result of seeing so
much pain and misery. I have been a machine
too long. I want to be thrust into the middle of
some fairy story before I die. I have never been
in love, in a violent rage. I haven&#8217;t known anything
but work and an abiding discontent. Red
hair&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it really isn&#8217;t red. It&#8217;s like the copper
beech in the sunshine, full of glowing embers.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a poet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On my word, I don&#8217;t know what I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is fire enough in you. The way you
tossed about our boys and the Japs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the blood. My father and I used to dress
for dinner, but we always carried the stone axe under
our coats. We were both to blame, but only a
miracle will ever bring us together. I&#8217;m sorry I ran
into him. It brings the old days crowding back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll survive! Somewhere there&#8217;s a niche
for me, and sooner or later I&#8217;ll find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He stopped me in the lobby after you left.
Wanted to know what name you were using. I
told him rather bluntly&mdash;and he went on. Something
in his voice&mdash;made me want to strike him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison balanced a fork on a finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny old world, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very. But I&#8217;ve seen him somewhere before.
Perhaps in a little while it will come back....
What an extraordinarily handsome man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;&mdash;with a touch of brusqueness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sitting at the table on your left.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain turned. The man at the other
table caught his eye, smiled, and rose. As he approached
Jane noticed with a touch of pity that the
man limped oddly. His left leg seemed to slue
about queerly just before it touched the floor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well! Captain Cleigh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison accepted the proffered hand, but
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the way back to the States?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Wanderer</i> is down the river. I suppose
you&#8217;ll be going home on her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My orders prevent that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run into the old boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; with a wry smile at Jane. &#8220;Miss
Norman, Mr. Cunningham. Where the shark is,
there will be the pilot fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger turned his eyes toward Jane&#8217;s.
The beauty of those dark eyes startled her. Fire
opals! They seemed to dig down into her very
soul, as if searching for something. He bowed
gravely and limped back to his table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I begin to understand,&#8221; was Dennison&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All this racket about those beads. My father
and this man Cunningham in the same town
generally has significance. It is eight years since I
saw Cunningham. Of course I could not forget
his face, but it&#8217;s rather remarkable that he remembered
mine. He is&mdash;if you tear away the
romance&mdash;nothing more or less than a thief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A thief?&#8221;&mdash;astonishedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not the ordinary kind; something of a prince
of thieves. He makes it possible&mdash;he and his
ilk&mdash;for men like my father to establish private
museums. And now I&#8217;m going to ask you to do me
a favour. It&#8217;s just a hunch. Hide those beads
the moment you reach your room. They are
yours as much as any one&#8217;s, and they may bring
you a fancy penny&mdash;if my hunch is worth anything.
Hang that pigtail, for getting you mixed
up in this! I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane&#8217;s hand went slowly to her throat; and even
as her fingers touched the beads, now warm from
contact, she became aware of something electrical
which drew her eyes compellingly toward the man
with the face of Ganymede and the limp of Vulcan.
Four times she fought in vain, during dinner, that
drawing, burning glance&mdash;and it troubled her.
Never before had a man&#8217;s eye forced hers in this
indescribable fashion. It was almost as if the
man had said, &#8220;Look at me! Look at me!&#8221;</p>
<p>After coffee she decided to retire, and bade
Dennison good-night. Once in her room she laid
the beads on the dresser and sat down by the window
to recast the remarkable ending of this day.
From the stars to the room, from the room to the
stars, her glance roved uneasily. Had she fallen
upon an adventure? Was Dennison&#8217;s theory
correct regarding the beads? She rose and went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
to the dresser, inspecting the beads carefully.
Positively glass! That Anthony Cleigh should be
seeking a string of glass beads seemed arrant nonsense.</p>
<p>She hung the beads on her throat and viewed
the result in the mirror. It was then that her eye
met a golden glint. She turned to see what had
caused it, and was astonished to discover on the
floor near the molding that poor Chinaman&#8217;s brass
hand warmer. She picked it up and turned back
the jigsawed lid. The receptacle was filled with
the ash of punk and charcoal.</p>
<p>There came a knock on the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p>Now, then, the further adventures of Ling
Foo of Woosung Road. He was an honest
Chinaman. He would beat you down
if he were buying, or he would overcharge you if
he were selling. There was nothing dishonest in
this; it was legitimate business. He was only
shrewd, not crooked. But on this day he came
into contact with a situation that tried his soul,
and tricked him into overplaying his hand.</p>
<p>That morning he had returned to his shop in a
contented frame of mind. He stood clear of the
tragedy of the night before. That had never
happened; he had dreamed it. Of course he would
be wondering whether or not the man had died.</p>
<p>When Ling Foo went forth with his business
in his pack he always closed the shop. Here in
upper Woosung Road it would not have paid
him to hire a clerk. His wife, obedient creature
though she was, spoke almost no pidgin&mdash;business&mdash;English;
and besides that, she was a poor
bargainer.</p>
<p>It was hard by noon when he let himself into the
shop. The first object he sought was his metal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
pipe. Two puffs, and the craving was satisfied.
He took up his counting rack and slithered the
buttons back and forth. He had made three
sales at the Astor and two at the Palace, which
was fair business, considering the times.</p>
<p>A shadow fell across the till top. Ling Foo
raised his slanted eyes. His face was like a graven
Buddha&#8217;s, but there was a crackling in his ears as
of many fire-crackers. There he stood&mdash;the man
with the sluing walk! Ling Foo still wore a queue,
so his hair could not very well stand on end.</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a question; it was a statement.</p>
<p>Ling Foo shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the pidgin. Your neighbour says
you speak English fluently. At Moy&#8217;s tea-house
restaurant they say that you lived in California for
several years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve,&#8221; said Ling Foo with a certain dry
humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you admit me last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shop closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is what?&#8221; asked the merchant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The string of glass beads you found on the
floor last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sense of disaster rolled over the Oriental. Had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
he been overhasty in ridding himself of the beads?
Patience! Wait a bit! Let the stranger open the
door to the mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glass beads?&#8221; he repeated, ruminatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you ten gold for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha! Now they were getting somewhere. Ten
gold! Then those devil beads had some worth
outside a jeweller&#8217;s computations? Ling Foo
smiled and spread his yellow hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Oriental loaded his pipe and fired it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the man who stumbled in here last
night?&#8221; he countered.</p>
<p>&#8220;His body is probably in the Yang-tse by now,&#8221;
returned Cunningham, grimly.</p>
<p>He knew his Oriental. He would have to
frighten this Chinaman badly, or engage his
cupidity to a point where resistance would be
futile.</p>
<p>There was a devil brooding over his head. Ling
Foo felt it strangely. His charms were in the far
room. He would have to fend off the devil without
material aid, and that was generally a hopeless
job. With that twist of Oriental thought which
will never be understood by the Occidental, Ling
Foo laid down his campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it, true. But I sold it this morning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For how much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four Mex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham laughed. It was actually honest
laughter, provoked by a lively sense of humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom did you sell it, and where can I find
the buyer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo picked up the laughter, as it were, and
gave his individual quirk to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Cunningham, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that necklace back for me and I will give
you a hundred gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw what happened last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you will not beat in my head,&#8221; Ling Foo
declared, easily. &#8220;What is there about this string
of beads that makes it worth a hundred gold&mdash;and
life worth nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Cunningham, resignedly. &#8220;I
am a secret agent of the British Government.
That string of glass beads is the key to a code relating
to the uprisings in India. The loss of it
will cost a great deal of money and time. Bring
it back here this afternoon, and I will pay down
five hundred gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; replied Ling Foo, tossing his pipe into
the alcove. &#8220;But no one must follow me. I do
not trust you. There is nothing to prevent you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
from robbing me in the street and refusing to pay
me. And where will you get five hundred gold?
Gold has vanished. Even the leaf has all but disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham dipped his hand into a pocket, and
magically a dozen double eagles rolled and vibrated
upon the counter, sending into Ling Foo&#8217;s
ears that music so peculiar to gold. Many days
had gone by since he had set his gaze upon the
yellow metal. His hand reached down&mdash;only to
feel&mdash;but not so quickly as the white hand, which
scooped up the coin trickily, with the skill of a
prestidigitator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred gold, then. But are you sure
you can get the beads back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a way. I will meet you in the lobby of
the Astor House at five&#8221;; and he bowed with
Oriental courtesy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed. All aboveboard, remember, or you
will feel the iron hand of the British Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo doubted that, but he kept this doubt
to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn you, I shall go armed. You will bring
the gold to the Astor House. If I see you after
I depart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love you, once that code key is in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
hands you can go to heaven or the devil, as you
please! We live in rough times, Ling Foo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So we do. There is a stain on the floor, about
where you stand. It is the blood of a white man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you, when a comrade attempts to
deceive you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At five in the lobby of the Astor House. Good
day,&#8221; concluded Ling Foo, fingering the buttons
on his counting rack.</p>
<p>Cunningham limped out into the cold sunshine.
Ling Foo shook his head. So like a boy&#8217;s, that
face! He shuddered slightly. He knew that a
savage devil lay ready behind that handsome mask&mdash;he
had seen it last night. But five hundred
gold&mdash;for a string of glass beads!</p>
<p>Ling Foo was an honest man. He would pay
you cash for cash in a bargain. If he overcharged
you that was your fault, but he never sold you
imitations on the basis that you would not know
the difference. If he sold you a Ming jar&mdash;for
twice what it was worth in the great marts&mdash;experts
would tell you that it was Ming. He had
some jade of superior quality&mdash;the translucent
deep apple-green. He never carried it about; he
never even spoke of it unless he was sure that the
prospective customer was wealthy.</p>
<p>His safe was in a corner of his workshop. An
American yegg would have laughed at it, opened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
it as easily as a ripe peach; but in this district it
was absolute security. Ling Foo was obliged to
keep a safe, for often he had valuable pearls to take
care of, sometimes to put new vigour in dying
lustre, sometimes to peel a pearl on the chance that
under the dull skin lay the gem.</p>
<p>He trotted to the front door and locked it; then
he trotted into his workshop, planning. If the
glass beads were worth five hundred, wasn&#8217;t it
likely they would be worth a thousand? If this
man who limped had stuck to the hundred Ling
Foo knew that he would have surrendered eventually.
But the ease with which the stranger made
the jump from one to five convinced Ling Foo that
there could be no harm in boosting five to ten. If
there was a taint of crookedness anywhere, that
would be on the other side. Ling Foo knew where
the beads were, and he would transfer them for one
thousand gold. Smart business, nothing more
than that. He had the whip hand.</p>
<p>Out of his safe he took a blackwood box, beautifully
carved, Cantonese. Headbands, earrings,
rings, charms, necklaces, tomb ornaments, some
of them royal, all of them nearly as ancient as the
hills of Kwanlun, from which most of them had
been quarried&mdash;jade. He trickled them from
palm to palm and one by one returned the objects
to the box. In the end he retained two strings of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
beads so alike that it was difficult to discern any
difference. One was Kwanlun jade, royal loot;
the other was a copy in Nanshan stone. The
first was priceless, worth what any fool collector
was ready to pay; the copy was worth perhaps
a hundred gold. Held to the light, there was a
subtle difference; but only an expert could have
told you what this difference was. The royal jade
did not catch the light so strongly as the copy; the
touch of human warmth had slightly dulled the
stone.</p>
<p>Ling Foo transferred the copy to a purse he wore
attached to his belt under the blue jacket. The
young woman would never be able to resist the
jade. She would return the glass instantly. A
thousand gold, less the cost of the jade! Good
business!</p>
<p>But for once his Oriental astuteness overreached,
as has been seen. And to add to his discomfiture,
he never again saw the copy of the Kwanlun,
representing the virtue of the favourite wife.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;I am an honest man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The tombs
of my ancestors are not neglected. When I say I
could not get it I speak the truth. But I believe
I can get it later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Cunningham. They were in the
office, or bureau, of the Astor House, which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
manager had turned over to them for the moment.
&#8220;Remember, the arm of the British Government
is long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being an honest man, I do not fear. She
would have given it to me but for that officer. He
knew something about jade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conceivably he would.&#8221; He jingled the gold
in his pocket. &#8220;How do you purpose to get the
beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the lady&#8217;s room late. I left the jade with
her. Alone, she will not resist. I saw it in her
eyes. But it will be difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. For you to get into the hotel late. I&#8217;ll
arrange that with the manager. You will be
coming to my room. What floor is her room
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The third.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same as mine. That falls nicely. Return
then at half after ten. You will come to my room
for the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo saw his thousand shrink to the original
five hundred, but there was no help for it. At
half after ten he knocked on the panel of Jane&#8217;s
door and waited. He knocked again; still the
summons was not answered. The third assault
was emphatic. Ling Foo heard footsteps, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
behind him. He turned. The meddling young
officer was striding toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; Dennison demanded.</p>
<p>His own appearance in the corridor at this hour
might have been subjectable to inquiry. He had
left Jane at nine. He had seen her to the lift.
Perhaps he had walked the Bund for an hour or
two, but worriedly. The thought of the arrival
in Shanghai of his father and the rogue Cunningham
convinced him that some queer game was
afoot, and that it hinged somehow upon those
beads.</p>
<p>There was no sighing in regard to his father, for
the past that was. An astonishing but purely
accidental meeting; to-morrow each would go his
separate way again. All that was a closed page.
He had long ago readjusted his outlook on the
basis that reconciliation was hopeless.</p>
<p>A sudden impulse spun him on his heel, and he
hurried back to the Astor. The hour did not
matter, or the possibility that Jane might be abed.
He would ask permission to become the temporary
custodian of the beads. What were they, to have
brought his father across the Pacific&mdash;if indeed
they had? Anyhow, he would end his own anxiety
in regard to Jane by assuming the risks, if any,
himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>No one questioned him; his uniform was a passport
that required no visé.</p>
<p>Ling Foo eyed him blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am leaving for the province in the morning,
so I had to come for my jade to-night. But the
young lady is not in her room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be!&#8221; cried Dennison, alarmed.
&#8220;Miss Norman?&#8221; he called, beating on the door.</p>
<p>No sound answered from within. Dennison
pondered for a moment. Ling Foo also pondered&mdash;apprehensively.
He suspected that some misfortune
had befallen the young woman, for her
kind did not go prowling alone round Shanghai at
night. Slue-Foot! Should he utter his suspicion
to this American officer? But if it should become
a police affair! Bitterly he arraigned himself for
disclosing his hand to Slue-Foot. That demon had
forestalled him. No doubt by now he had the
beads. Ten thousand devils pursue him!</p>
<p>Dennison struck his hands together, and by and
by a sleepy Chinese boy came scuffling along the
corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talkee manager come topside,&#8221; said Dennison.
When the manager arrived, perturbed, Dennison
explained the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you open the door?&#8221;</p>
<p>The manager agreed to do that. The bedroom
was empty. The bed had not been touched. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
there was no evidence that the occupant did not
intend to return.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall leave everything just as it is,&#8221; said
Dennison, authoritatively. &#8220;I am her friend. If
she does not return by one o&#8217;clock I shall notify
the police and have the young lady&#8217;s belongings
transferred to the American consulate. She is
under the full protection of the United States
Government. You will find out if any saw her
leave the hotel, and what the time was. Stay
here in the doorway while I look about.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw the jade necklace reposing in the soap
dish, and in an ironical mood he decided not to
announce the discovery to the Chinaman. Let
him pay for his cupidity. In some mysterious
manner he had got his yellow claws on those
infernal beads, and the rogue Cunningham had
gone to him with a substantial bribe. So let the
pigtail wail for his jade.</p>
<p>On the dresser he saw a sheet of paper partly
opened. Beside it lay a torn envelope. Dennison&#8217;s
heart lost a beat. The handwriting was his
father&#8217;s!</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p>Jane had gone to meet his father. How to
secrete this note without being observed by
either the manager or the Chinaman? An
accident came to his aid. Someone in the corridor
banged a door violently, and as the manager&#8217;s
head and Ling Foo&#8217;s jerked about, Dennison stuffed
the note into a pocket.</p>
<p>A trap! Dennison wasn&#8217;t alarmed&mdash;he was
only furious. Jane had walked into a trap. She
had worn those accursed beads when his father had
approached her by the bookstall that afternoon.
The note had attacked her curiosity from a
perfectly normal angle. Dennison had absorbed
enough of the note&#8217;s contents to understand how
readily Jane had walked into the trap.</p>
<p>Very well. He would wait in the lobby until
one; then if Jane had not returned he would lay
the plans of a counter-attack, and it would be a
rough one. Of course no bodily harm would befall
Jane, but she would probably be harried and
bullied out of those beads. But would she? It
was not unlikely that she would become a pretty
handful, once she learned she had been tricked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
If she balked him, how would the father act? The
old boy was ruthless when he particularly wanted
something.</p>
<p>If anything should happen to her&mdash;an event unlooked
for, accidental, over which his father would
have no control&mdash;this note would bring the old
boy into a peck of trouble; and Dennison was loyal
enough not to wish this to happen. And yet it
would be only just to make the father pay once for
his high-handedness. That would be droll&mdash;to
see his father in the dock, himself as a witness
against him! Here was the germ of a tiptop
drama.</p>
<p>But all this worry was doubtless being wasted
upon mere supposition. Jane might turn over
the beads without bargaining, provided the father
had any legal right to them, which Dennison
strongly doubted.</p>
<p>He approached Ling Foo and seized him roughly
by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about these glass beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo elevated a shoulder and let it fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, except that the man who owns them
demands that I recover them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is this man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t pass. You tell me who he is or
I&#8217;ll turn you over to the police.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am an honest man,&#8221; replied Ling Foo with
dignity. He appealed to the manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known Ling Foo a long time, sir. He
is perfectly honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo nodded. He knew that this recommendation,
honest as it was, would have weight
with the American.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have some appointment with this man.
Where is that to be? I demand to know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo saw his jade vanish along with his rainbow
gold. His early suppositions had been correct.</p>
<p>Those were devil beads, and evil befell any who
touched them.</p>
<p>Silently he cursed the soldier&#8217;s ancestors half a
thousand years back. If the white fool hadn&#8217;t
meddled in the parlour that afternoon!</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; he said, finally.</p>
<p>The game was played out; the counters had gone
back to the basket. He had no desire to come
into contact with police officials. Only it was as
bitter as the gall of chicken, and he purposed to
lessen his own discomfort by making the lame
man share it. Oriental humour.</p>
<p>Dennison and the hotel manager followed him
curiously. At the end of the corridor Ling Foo
stopped and knocked on a door. It was opened
immediately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The inflections touched Dennison&#8217;s sense of
humour, and he smiled. A greeting with a snap-back
of dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had a suspicion
I&#8217;d find you in this somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find me in what?&#8221; asked Cunningham, his
poise recovered. He, too, began to smile. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about these glass beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glass beads? Oh, yes. But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy you&#8217;d better come out into the clear,
Cunningham,&#8221; said Dennison, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wish to know about those beads? Very
well, I&#8217;ll explain, because something has happened&mdash;I
know not what. You all look so infernally
serious. Those beads are a key to a code. The
British Government is keenly anxious to recover
this key. In the hands of certain Hindus those
beads would constitute bad medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo spread his hands relievedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the story. I was to receive five hundred
gold for their recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A code key,&#8221; said Dennison, musing.</p>
<p>He knew Cunningham was lying. Anthony
Cleigh wasn&#8217;t the man to run across half the world
for a British code key. On the other hand, perhaps
it would be wise to let the hotel manager and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the Chinaman continue in the belief that the affair
concerned a British code.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did not know you tolerably well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear captain, you don&#8217;t know me at all,&#8221;
interrupted Cunningham. &#8220;Have you got the
beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not. I doubt if you will ever lay eyes
on them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something flashed across the handsome face.
Ling Foo alone recognized it. He had glimpsed
it, this expression, outside his window the night
before. He recalled the dark stain on the floor of
his shop, and he also recollected a saying of Confucius
relative to greed. He wished he was back
in his shop, well out of this muddle. The jade
could go, valuable as it was. With his hands
tucked in his sleeves he waited.</p>
<p>Dennison turned upon the manager. He wanted
to be alone with Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go down and make inquiries, and take this
Chinaman with you. I&#8217;ll be with you shortly.&#8221;
As soon as the two were out of the way Dennison
said: &#8220;Cunningham, the lady who wore those
beads at dinner to-night has gone out alone, wearing
them. If I find that you are anywhere back
of this venture&mdash;if she does not return shortly&mdash;I
will break you as I would a churchwarden pipe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham appeared genuinely taken aback.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She went out alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you notified the police?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. I&#8217;m giving her until one; then I
shall start something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something tells me,&#8221; said Cunningham, easily,
&#8220;that Miss Norman is in no danger. But she
would never have gone out if I had been in the
lobby. If she has not returned by one call me.
Any assistance I can give will be given gladly.
Women ought never to be mixed up in affairs such
as this one, on this side of the world. Tell your
father that he ought to know by this time that he
is no match for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Innocent! You know very well what I mean.
If you hadn&#8217;t a suspicion of what has happened
you would be roaring up and down the corridors
with the police. You run true to the breed. It&#8217;s
a good one, I&#8217;ll admit. But your father will regret
this night&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. Here, read this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison extended the note. Cunningham,
his brows bent, ran through the missive.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Miss Norman</span>: Will you do me the honour to meet me
at the bridgehead at half-past nine&mdash;practically at once?
My son and I are not on friendly terms. Still, I am his
father, and I&#8217;d like to hear what he has been doing over here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
I will have a limousine, and we can ride out on the Bubbling
Well Road while we talk.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Anthony Cleigh</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Cunningham, returning
the note, &#8220;that you two were at odds. But this is
a devil of a mix-up, if it&#8217;s what I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he&#8217;s abducted her&mdash;carried her off to the
yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no fool,&#8221; was the son&#8217;s defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t, eh? Lord love you, sonny, your
father and I are the two biggest fools on all God&#8217;s
earth!&#8221;</p>
<p>The door closed sharply in Dennison&#8217;s face and
the key rasped in the lock.</p>
<p>For a space Dennison did not stir. Why should
he wish to protect his father? Between his father
and this handsome rogue there was small choice.
The old boy made such rogues possible. But
supposing Cleigh had wished really to quiz Jane?
To find out something about these seven years,
lean and hard, with stretches of idleness and
stretches of furious labour, loneliness? Well, the
father would learn that in all these seven years the
son had never faltered from the high level he had
set for his conduct. That was a stout staff to lean
on&mdash;he had the right to look all men squarely in
the eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>He had been educated to inherit millions; he had
not been educated to support himself by work in a
world that specialized. He had in these seven
years been a jeweller&#8217;s clerk, an auctioneer in a
salesroom; he had travelled from Baluchistan to
Damascus with carpet caravans, but he had never
forged ahead financially. Generally the end of a
job had been the end of his resources. One fact
the thought of which never failed to buck him up&mdash;he
had never traded on his father&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Then had come the war. He had returned to
America, trained, and they had assigned him to
Russia. But that had not been without its reward&mdash;he
had met Jane.</p>
<p>In a New York bank, to his credit, was the sum
of twenty thousand dollars, at compound interest
for seven years, ready to answer to the scratch of a
pen, but he had sworn he would never touch a
dollar of it. Never before had the thought of it
risen so strongly to tempt him. His for the mere
scratch of a pen!</p>
<p>In the lobby he found the manager pacing
nervously, while Ling Foo sat patiently and inscrutably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wait?&#8221; inquired Dennison, irritably.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady has some jade of mine,&#8221; returned
Ling Foo, placidly. &#8220;It was a grave mistake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you interfered this afternoon. The lady
would be in her room at this hour. The devil
beads would not be casting a spell on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil beads, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling Foo shrugged and ran his hands into his
sleeves. Somewhere along the banks of the
Whangpoo or the Yang-tse would be the body of
an unknown, but Ling Foo&#8217;s lips were locked quite
as securely as the dead man&#8217;s. Devil beads they
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did the man upstairs leave the beads
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will tell you. It is none of my affair now.&#8221;
And that was all Dennison could dig out of Ling
Foo.</p>
<p>Jane Norman did not return at one o&#8217;clock; in
fact, she never returned to the Astor House.
Dennison waited until three; then he went back
to the Palace, and Ling Foo to his shop and oblivion.</p>
<p>Dennison decided that he did not want the
police in the affair. In that event there would be
a lot of publicity, followed by the kind of talk that
stuck. He was confident that he could handle the
affair alone. So he invented a white lie, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
nobody questioned it because of his uniform. Miss
Norman had found friends, and shortly she would
send for her effects; but until that time she desired
the consulate to take charge. Under the eyes of
the relieved hotel manager and an indifferent clerk
from the consulate the following morning Dennison
packed Jane&#8217;s belongings and conveyed them
to the consulate, which was hard by. Next he
proceeded to the water front and engaged a motor
boat. At eleven o&#8217;clock he drew up alongside the
<i>Wanderer II</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there!&#8221; shouted a seaman. &#8220;Sheer off!
Orders to receive no visitors!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison began to mount, ignoring the order.
It was a confusing situation for the sailor. If he
threw this officer into the yellow water&mdash;as certainly
he would have thrown a civilian&mdash;Uncle
Sam might jump on his back and ride him to clink.
Against this was the old man, the very devil for
obedience to his orders. If he pushed this lad
over, the clink; if he let him by, the old man&#8217;s foot.
And while the worried seaman was reaching for
water with one hand and wind with the other, as
the saying goes, Dennison thrust him roughly
aside, crossed the deck to the main companionway,
and thundered down into the salon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p>Cleigh sat before a card table; he was
playing Chinese Canfield. He looked up,
but he neither rose nor dropped the half-spent
deck of cards he held in his hand. The
bronzed face, the hard agate blue of the eyes that
met his own, the utter absence of visible agitation,
took the wind out of Dennison&#8217;s sails and left him
all a-shiver, like a sloop coming about on a fresh
tack. He had made his entrance stormily enough,
but now the hot words stuffed his throat to choking.</p>
<p>Cleigh was thirty years older than his son; he
was a finished master of sentimental emotions;
he could keep all his thoughts out of his countenance
when he so willed. But powerful as his will
was, in this instance it failed to reach down into
his heart; and that thumped against his ribs
rather painfully. The boy!</p>
<p>Dennison, aware that he stood close to the
ridiculous, broke the spell and advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come for Miss Norman,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cleigh scrutinized the cards and shifted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found your note to her. I&#8217;ve a launch. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
don&#8217;t know what the game is, but I&#8217;m going to take
Miss Norman back with me if I have to break in
every door on board!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh stood up. As he did so Dodge, the Texan
appeared in the doorway to the dining salon.
Dennison saw the blue barrel of a revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gunman, eh? All right. Let&#8217;s see if he&#8217;ll
shoot,&#8221; said the son, walking deliberately toward
Dodge.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dodge!&#8221; Cleigh called out as the Texan,
raised the revolver. &#8220;You may go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dodge, a good deal astonished, backed out.
Once more father and son stared at each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better call it off,&#8221; advised the son. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t hold Miss Norman&mdash;and I can make a
serious charge. Bring her at once, or I&#8217;ll go for
her. And the Lord help the woodwork if I start!&#8221;</p>
<p>But even as he uttered the threat Dennison
heard a sound behind. He turned, but not soon
enough. In a second he was on the floor, three
husky seamen mauling him. They had their hands
full for a while, but in the end they conquered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What next, sir?&#8221; asked one of the sailors,
breathing hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tie him up and lock him in Cabin Two.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first order was executed. After Dennison&#8217;s
arms and ankles were bound the men stood him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really my father?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Cleigh returned to his cards and shuffled them
for a new deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t untie him. He might walk through
the partition. He will have the freedom of the
deck when we are out of the delta.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison was thereupon carried to Cabin Two,
and deposited upon the stationary bed. He began
to laugh. There was a sardonic note in this
laughter, like that which greets you when you recount
some incredible tale. His old cabin!</p>
<p>The men shook their heads, as if confronted by
something so unusual that it wasn&#8217;t worth while
to speculate upon it. The old man&#8217;s son! They
went out, locking the door. By this time Dennison&#8217;s
laughter had reached the level of shouting,
but only he knew how near it was to tears&mdash;wrathful,
murderous, miserable tears! He fought his
bonds terrifically for a moment, then relaxed.</p>
<p>For seven years he had been hugging the hope
that when he and his father met blood would tell,
and that their differences would vanish in a strong
handclasp; and here he lay, trussed hand and foot,
in his old cabin, not a crack in that granite lump
his father called a heart!</p>
<p>A childish thought! Some day to take that
twenty thousand with accrued interest, ride up to
the door, step inside, dump the silver on that old
red Samarkand, and depart&mdash;forever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>Where was she? This side of the passage or the
other?</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman?&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; came almost instantly from the cabin
aft.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Captain Dennison. I&#8217;m tied up and
lying on the bed. Can you hear me distinctly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Your father has made a prisoner of you?
Of all the inhuman acts! You came in search of
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally. Have you those infernal beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison twisted about until he had his shoulders
against the brass rail of the bed head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a trick. It was not to talk about
you&mdash;he wanted the beads, and that made me
furious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you hurt in the struggle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any. I really don&#8217;t know what
possessed me. Perhaps I was a bit hypnotized.
Perhaps I was curious. Perhaps I wanted&mdash;some
excitement. On my word, I don&#8217;t know just what
happened. Anyhow, here I am&mdash;in a dinner
gown, bound for Hong-Kong, so he says. He offered
me ten thousand for the beads, and my freedom,
if I would promise not to report his high-handedness;
and I haven&#8217;t uttered a sound.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven on earth, why didn&#8217;t you accept his
offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment of silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, I haven&#8217;t the beads. In the
second place, I want to make him all the trouble
I possibly can. Now that he has me, he doesn&#8217;t
know what to do with me. Hoist by his own
petard. Do you want the truth? Well, I&#8217;m not
worried in the least. I feel as if I&#8217;d been invited to
some splendiferous picnic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s foolish,&#8221; he remonstrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is. But it&#8217;s the sort of foolishness
I&#8217;ve been aching for all my life. I knew something
was going to happen. I broke my hand mirror
night before last. Two times seven years&#8217; bad
luck. Now he has me, I&#8217;ll wager he&#8217;s half frightened
out of his wits. But what made you think of
the yacht?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We forced the door of your room, and I found
the note. Has he told you what makes those infernal
beads so precious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t figure that out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more can I. Did he threaten you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Would I enter the launch peacefully, or
would he have to carry me? I didn&#8217;t want my
gown spoiled&mdash;it&#8217;s the only decent one I have.
I&#8217;m not afraid. It isn&#8217;t as though he were a
stranger. Being your father, he would never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
stoop to any indignity. But he&#8217;ll find he has
caught a tartar. I had an idea you&#8217;d find me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have. But you won&#8217;t get to Hong-Kong.
The minute he liberates me I&#8217;ll sneak into
the wireless room and bring the destroyers. I
didn&#8217;t notify the police from a bit of foolish sentiment.
I didn&#8217;t quite want you mixed up in the
story. I had your things conveyed to the consulate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My story&mdash;which few men would believe.
I&#8217;ve thought of that. Are you smoking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smoking, with my hands tied behind my
back? Not so you&#8217;d notice it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I smell tobacco smoke&mdash;a good cigar, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then someone is in the passage listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence. Anthony Cleigh eyed his perfecto
rather ruefully and tiptoed back to the salon.
Hoist by his own petard. He was beginning to
wonder. Cleigh was a man who rarely regretted
an act, but in the clear light of day he was beginning
to have his doubts regarding this one. A
mere feather on the wrong side of the scale, and
the British destroyers would be atop of him like a
flock of kites. Abduction! Cut down to bedrock,
he had laid himself open to that. He ran his
fingers through his cowlicks. But drat the woman!
why had she accepted the situation so docilely?
Since midnight not a sound out of her, not a wail,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
not a sob. Now he had her, he couldn&#8217;t let her
go. She was right there.</p>
<p>There was one man in the crew Cleigh had begun
to dislike intensely, and he had been man&oelig;uvring
ever since Honolulu to find a legitimate excuse to
give the man his papers. Something about the
fellow suggested covert insolence; he had the air
of a beachcomber who had unexpectedly fallen
into a soft berth, and it had gone to his head. He
had been standing watch at the ladder head, and
against positive orders he had permitted a visitor
to pass him. To Cleigh this was the handle he had
been hunting for. He summoned the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your duffle,&#8221; said Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your stuff. You&#8217;re through. You had
positive orders, and you let a man by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But his uniform fussed me, sir. I didn&#8217;t know
just how to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your stuff! Mr. Cleve will give you
your pay. My orders are absolute. Off with
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sailor sullenly obeyed. He found the first
officer alone in the chart house.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boss has sent me for my pay, Mr. Cleve.
I&#8217;m fired.&#8221; Flint grinned amiably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fired? Well, well,&#8221; said Cleve, &#8220;that&#8217;s certainly
tough luck&mdash;all this way from home. I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
have to pay you in Federal Reserve bills. The
old man has the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Federal Reserve it is. Forty-six dollars in
Uncle Samuels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first officer solemnly counted out the sum
and laid it on the palm of the discharged man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tough world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not worrying! I&#8217;ll bet you this
forty-six against ten that I&#8217;ve another job before
midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Cleve grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always looking for sure-thing bets! Better
hail that bumboat with the vegetables to row you
into town. The old man&#8217;ll dump you over by hand
if he finds you here between now and sundown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try the launch there. Tell the lad his fare
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; back to Shanghai. Of course it makes
it a bit inconvenient, packing and unpacking; but
I guess I can live through it. But what about the
woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleve plucked at his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Messes up the show a bit. Pippin, though. I
like &#8217;em when they walk straight and look straight
like this one. Notice her hair? You never tame
that sort beyond parlour manners. But I don&#8217;t
like her on board here, or the young fellow, either.
Don&#8217;t know him, but he&#8217;s likely to bust the yacht
wide open if he gets loose.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so long, Mary! Know what my first
move&#8217;ll be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bottle somewhere. But mind your step!
Don&#8217;t monkey with the stuff beyond normal. You
know what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Only a peg or two, after all this psalm-singing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Flint. But this game is no joke.
You know what happened in town? Morrissy was
near croaked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flint&#8217;s face lost some of its gayety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know how to handle the stuff! See you
later.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Cleigh decided to see what the girl&#8217;s temper was,
so he entered the passage on the full soles of his
shoes. He knocked on her door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a good sign; she was ready to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to repeat that offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cleigh, I have nothing to say so long as the
key is on the wrong side of the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh heard a chuckle from Cabin Two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Remember, I offered
you liberty conditionally. If you suffer inconveniences
after to-night you will have only yourself
to thank.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you calculated that some day you will
have to let me go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have calculated on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that I shall go to the nearest authorities
and report this action?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will think a moment,&#8221; said Cleigh, his
tone monotonously level, &#8220;you will dismiss that
plan for two reasons: First, that no one will believe
you; second, that no one will want to believe
you. That&#8217;s as near as I care to put it. Your
imagination will grasp it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Instantly!&#8221; cried the girl, hotly. &#8220;I knew you
to be cold and hard, but I did not believe you were
a scoundrel&mdash;having known your son!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I disowned him. He is absolutely nothing to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe that,&#8221; came back through the
cabin door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, it is the truth. The queer part is,
I&#8217;ve tried to resurrect the father instinct, and can&#8217;t.
I&#8217;ve tried to go round the wall&mdash;over it. I might
just as well try to climb the Upper Himalayas.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Cabin Two the son stared at the white ceiling.
It seemed to him that all his vitals had been
wrenched out of him, leaving him hollow, empty.
He knew his father&#8217;s voice; it rang with truth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I offer you ten thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key is still on the outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to trust you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand each other perfectly,&#8221; said
Jane, ironically.</p>
<p>The son smiled. The sense of emptiness vanished,
and there came into his blood a warmth as
sweet as it was strong. Jane Norman, angel of
mercy. He heard his father speaking again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you will have it so, you will go to Hong-Kong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Patagonia if you wish! You cannot scare
me by threatening me with travel on a private
yacht. I had the beads, it is true; but at this
moment I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea where they
are; and if I had I should not tell you. I refuse to
buy my liberty; you will have to give it to me without
conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t anything on board in shape
of women&#8217;s clothes, but I&#8217;ll send for your stuff if
you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the single consideration you have
shown me. My belongings are at the American
consulate, and I should be glad to have
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find paper and ink in the escritoire.
Write me an order and I promise to attend to the
matter personally.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And search through everything at your
leisure!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh blushed, and he heard his son chuckle
again. He had certainly caught a tartar&mdash;possibly
two. With a twisted smile he recalled the old yarn
of the hunter who caught the bear by the tail.
Willing to let go, and daring not!</p>
<p>&#8220;Still I agree,&#8221; continued the girl. &#8220;I want
my own familiar things&mdash;if I must take this
forced voyage. But mark me, Mr. Cleigh, you
will pay some day! I&#8217;m not the clinging kind, and
I shall fight you tooth and nail from the first hour
of my freedom. I&#8217;m not without friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never in this world!&#8221; came resonantly from
Cabin Two.</p>
<p>Cleigh longed to get away. There was a
rumbling and a threatening inside of him that
needed space&mdash;Gargantuan laughter. Not the
clinging kind, this girl! And the boy, walking
straight at Dodge&#8217;s villainous revolver! Why, he
would need the whole crew behind him when he
liberated these two! But he knew that the
laughter striving for articulation was not the kind
heard in Elysian fields!</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will write the order I will execute it at
once. The consulate closes early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write it, but how will I get it to you?
The door closes below the sill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are ready, call, and I will open the
door a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be better if you opened it full wide.
This is China&mdash;I understand that. But we are
both Americans, and there&#8217;s a good sound law
covering an act like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it does not reach as far as China. Besides,
I have an asset back in the States. It is my word.
I have never broken it to any man or woman, and I
expect I never shall. You have, or have had, what
I consider my property. You have hedged the
question; you haven&#8217;t been frank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The son listened intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bought that string of glass beads in good
faith of a Chinaman&mdash;Ling Foo. I consider them
mine&mdash;that is, if they are still in my possession.
Between the hour I met you last night and the
moment of Captain Dennison&#8217;s entrance to my
room considerable time had elapsed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sufficient for a rogue like Cunningham to
make good use of,&#8221; supplemented the prisoner in
Cabin Two. &#8220;There&#8217;s a way of finding out the
facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You used to carry a planchette that once
belonged to the actress Rachel. Why not give it
a whirl? Everybody&#8217;s doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh eyed Cabin Four, then Cabin Two, and
shook his head slightly, dubiously. He was not getting
on well. To come into contact with a strong
will was always acceptable; and a strong will in a
woman was a novelty. All at once it struck him
forcibly that he stood on the edge of boredom; that
the lure which had brought him fully sixteen
thousand miles was losing its bite. Was he growing
old, drying up?</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me what it is about these beads
that makes you offer ten thousand for them?
Glass&mdash;anybody could see that. What makes
them as valuable as pearls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are love beads,&#8221; answered Cleigh, mockingly.
&#8220;They are far more potent than powdered
pearls. You have worn them about your throat,
Miss Norman, and the sequence is inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried Jane.</p>
<p>Dennison added his mite to the confusion:</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that scoundrel Cunningham was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
lying. He said the string was a code key belonging
to the British Intelligence Office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot!&#8221; Cleigh exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But hurry, Miss Norman. The sooner I have
that written order on the consulate the sooner
you&#8217;ll have your belongings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes later she announced that the
order was completed, and Cleigh opened the door
slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key will be given you the moment we
weigh anchor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; called the son, &#8220;you might drop into
the Palace and get my truck, too. I&#8217;m particular
about my toothbrushes.&#8221; A pause. &#8220;I&#8217;d like a
drink, too&mdash;if you&#8217;ve got the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh did not answer, but he presently entered
Cabin Two, filled a glass with water, raised his
son&#8217;s head to a proper angle, and gave him drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. This business strikes me as the
funniest thing I ever heard of! You would have
done that for a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh replaced the water carafe in the rack
above the wash bowl and went out, locking the
door. In the salon he called for Dodge:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going into town. I&#8217;ll be back round
five. Don&#8217;t stir from this cabin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember that fellow who was here night
before last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The good-looking chap that limped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m to crease him if he pokes his noodle
down the stairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly! No talk, no palaver! If he starts
talking he&#8217;ll talk you out of your boots. Shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the leg? All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>His employer having gone, Dodge sat in a corner
from which he could see the companionway and
all the passages. He lit a long black cigar, laid his
formidable revolver on a knee, and began his vigil.
A queer job for an old cow-punch, for a fact.</p>
<p>To guard an old carpet that didn&#8217;t have &#8220;welcome&#8221;
on it anywhere&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t get that, none
whatever. But there was a hundred a week, the
best grub pile in the world, and the old man&#8217;s
Havanas as often as he pleased. Pretty soft!</p>
<p>And he had learned a new trick&mdash;shooting
target in a rolling sea. He had wasted a hundred
rounds before getting the hang of it. Maybe
these sailors hadn&#8217;t gone pop-eyed when they saw
him pumping lead into the bull&#8217;s-eye six times
running? Tin cans and raw potatoes in the
water, too. Something to brag about if he ever
got back home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>He broke the gun and inspected the cylinder.
There wasn&#8217;t as much grease on the cartridges as
he would have liked.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Miss Norman?&#8221; called Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you comfortable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right. I&#8217;m only furious with rage,
that&#8217;s all. You are still tied?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t understand your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never understood him. Yet he was
very kind to me when I was little. I don&#8217;t suppose
there is anything in heaven or on earth that
he&#8217;s afraid of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is afraid of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. He would give anything to be rid
of me. But go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m something like him physically. We
are both so strong that we generally burst through
rather than take the trouble to go round. I&#8217;m
honestly sorry for him. Not a human being to
love or be loved by. He never had a dog. I don&#8217;t
recollect my mother; she died when I was three;
and that death had something to do with the iron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
in his soul. Our old butler used to tell me that
Father cursed horribly, I mean blasphemously,
when they took the mother out of the house.
There are some men like that, who love terribly,
away and beyond the average human ability.
After the mother died he plunged into the money
game. He was always making it, piling it up ruthlessly
but honestly. Then that craving petered
out, and he took a hand in the collecting game.
What will come next I don&#8217;t know. As a boy I
was always afraid of him. He was kind to me, but
in the abstract. I was like an extra on the
grocer&#8217;s bill. He put me into the hands of a tutor&mdash;a
lovable old dreamer&mdash;and paid no more
attention to me. He never put his arms round
me and told me fairy stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little boy! No fairy stories!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary a one until I began to have playmates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the ropes hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They might if I were alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of the beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that they have some strange value, or
father wouldn&#8217;t be after them. Love beads!
Doesn&#8217;t sound half so plausible as Cunningham&#8217;s
version.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That handsome man who limped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A real adventurer&mdash;the sort one reads about!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the queer thing about him, he keeps his
word, too, for all his business is a shady one. I
don&#8217;t suppose there is a painting or a jewel or a
book of the priceless sort that he doesn&#8217;t know
about, where it is and if it can be got at. Some of
his deals are aboveboard, but many of them aren&#8217;t.
I&#8217;ll wager these beads have a story of loot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What he steals doesn&#8217;t hurt the poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as the tigers fight among themselves
and leave the goats alone, it doesn&#8217;t stir you. Is
that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And besides, he&#8217;s a handsome beggar, if there
ever was one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has the face of an angel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the soul of a vandal!&#8221;&mdash;with a touch of
irritability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you aren&#8217;t fair. A vandal destroys
things; this man only transfers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a handsome monetary consideration&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only transfers a picture from one gallery to
another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve seen the last of him for a while,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you answer me a question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where those beads are?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A little while gone I smelt tobacco smoke,&#8221; she
answered, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. We&#8217;ll talk of something else then.
Have you ever been in love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Violently&mdash;so I believed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you got over it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely! And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t had the time. I&#8217;ve been too
busy earning bread and butter. What was she
like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A beautiful mirage&mdash;the lie in the desert, you
might say. Has it ever occurred to you that the
mirage is the one lie Nature utters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought. She deceived you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>A short duration of silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t hurt to talk about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, no! Because I wasn&#8217;t given fairy
stories when I was little, I took them seriously
when I was twenty-three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Puppy love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It went a little deeper than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t hate women?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I never hated the woman who deceived
me. I was terribly sorry for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For having lost so nice a husband?&#8221;&mdash;with a
bit of malice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>He greeted this with laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is written,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;that we must
play the fool sometime or other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever played it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but you never can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, you&#8217;re a brick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane!&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t suppose
there&#8217;s any harm in your calling me that, with
partitions in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They used to call me Denny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want me to call you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over&mdash;Denny!&#8221;</p>
<p>They laughed. Both recognized the basic fact
in this running patter. Each was trying to buck
up the other. Jane was honestly worried. She
could not say what it was that worried her, but
there was a strong leaven in her of old-wives&#8217;
prescience. It wasn&#8217;t due to this high-handed
adventure of Cleigh, senior; it was something
leaning down darkly from the future that worried
her. That hand mirror!</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not talk any more,&#8221; she advised.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be getting thirsty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m already that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a brave man, captain,&#8221; she said, her
tone altering from gayety to seriousness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry about me. I&#8217;ve always been able to take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
care of myself, though I&#8217;ve never been confronted
with this kind of a situation before. Frankly, I
don&#8217;t like it. But I suspect that your father will
have more respect for us if we laugh at him. Has
he a sense of humour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My word for it, he has! What could be more
humorous than tying me up in this fashion and
putting me in the cabin that used to be mine?
Ten thousand for a string of glass beads! I say,
Jane!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he comes back tell him you might consider
twenty thousand, just to get an idea what the
thing is worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll promise that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Then I&#8217;ll try to snooze a bit.
Getting stuffy lying on my back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The brute! If I could only help you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have&mdash;you are&mdash;you will!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on his side, his face toward the door.
His arms and legs began to sting with the sensation
known as sleep. He was glad his father had overheard
the initial conversation. A wave of terror
ran over him at the thought of being set ashore
while Jane went on. Still he could have sent a
British water terrier in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Jane sat down and took inventory. She knew
but little about antiques&mdash;rugs and furniture&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
she was full of inherent love of the beautiful.
The little secretary upon which she had written
the order on the consulate was an exquisite lowboy
of old mahogany of dull finish. On the floor were
camel saddle-bays, Persian in pattern. On the
panel over the lowboy was a small painting, a foot
broad and a foot and a half long. It was old&mdash;she
could tell that much. It was a portrait,
tender and quaint. She would have gasped had
she known that it was worth a cover of solid
gold. It was a Holbein, The Younger, for
which Cleigh some years gone had paid Cunningham
sixteen thousand dollars. Where and how
Cunningham had acquired it was not open
history.</p>
<p>An hour passed. By and by she rose and tiptoed
to the partition. She held her ear against
the panel, and as she heard nothing she concluded
that Denny&mdash;why not?&mdash;was asleep. Next she
gazed out of the port. It was growing dark outside,
overcast. It would rain again probably. A
drab sky, a drab shore. She saw a boat filled with
those luscious vegetables which wrote typhus for
any white person who ate them. A barge went by
piled high with paddy bags&mdash;rice in the husk&mdash;with
Chinamen at the forward and stern sweeps.
She wondered if these poor yellow people had ever
known what it was to play?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>Suddenly she fell back, shocked beyond measure.
From the direction of the salon&mdash;a pistol shot!
This was followed by the tramp of hurrying feet.
Voices, now sharp, now rumbling&mdash;this grew
nearer. A struggle of some dimensions was going
on in the passage. The racket reached her door,
but did not pause there. She sank into the chair,
a-tremble.</p>
<p>Dennison struggled to a sitting posture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit of mutiny, I take it; but it seems to be
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the shot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard no cry of pain, only a lot of scuffling
and some high words. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. Can&#8217;t you break a piece of glass and
saw your way out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love you, that&#8217;s movie stuff! If I had a
razor, I couldn&#8217;t manage it without hacking off my
hands. You are worried!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a woman, Denny. I&#8217;m not afraid of your
father; but if there is mutiny, with all these
treasures on board&mdash;and over here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll make a real effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could hear him stumbling about. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
heard the crash of the water carafe on the floor.
Several minutes dragged by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be done!&#8221; said Dennison. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
make the broken glass stay put. Can&#8217;t reach my
ankles, either, or I could get my feet free. There&#8217;s
a double latch on your door. See to it! Lord!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. Just hunting round for some cuss
words. Put the chair up against the door knob
and sit tight for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hours dragged by in stifling silence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cleigh, having attended to errands,
lunched, had gone to the American consulate and
presented the order. His name and reputation
cleared away the official red tape. He explained
that all the fuss of the night before had been without
cause. Miss Norman had come aboard the
yacht, and now decided to go to Hong-Kong with
the family. This suggested the presence of other
women on board. In the end, Jane&#8217;s worldly
goods were consigned to Cleigh, who signed the
receipt and made off for the launch.</p>
<p>It was growing dark. On the way down the
river Cleigh made no attempt to search for the
beads.</p>
<p>The salon lights snapped up as the launch drew
alongside. Once below, Cleigh dumped Jane&#8217;s
possessions into the nearest chair and turned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
give Dodge an order&mdash;only to find the accustomed
corner vacant!</p>
<p>&#8220;Dodge!&#8221; he shouted. He ran to the passage.
&#8220;Dodge, where the devil are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you call, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh spun about. In the doorway to the
dining salon stood Cunningham, on his amazingly
handsome face an expression of anxious solicitude!</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p>Cleigh was not only a big and powerful
man&mdash;he was also courageous, but the
absence of Dodge and the presence of
Cunningham offered such sinister omen that
temporarily he was bereft of his natural wit and
initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Dodge?&#8221; he asked, stupidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dodge is resting quietly,&#8221; answered Cunningham,
gravely. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be on his feet in a day or
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seemed to wake up Cleigh a bit. He drew
his automatic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Face to the wall, or I&#8217;ll send a bullet into
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you examine the clip this morning?
When you carry weapons like that for protection
never put it in your pocket without a look-see.
Dodge wouldn&#8217;t have made your mistake. Shoot!
Try it on the floor, or up through the lights&mdash;or at
me if you&#8217;d like that better. The clip is empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mechanically Cleigh took aim and bore against
the trigger. There was no explosion. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
depressing sense of unreality rolled over the <i>Wanderer&#8217;s</i>
owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you went into town for her luggage? Did
you find the beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh made a negative sign. It was less an
answer to Cunningham than an acknowledgment
that he could not understand why the bullet clip
should be empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an easy risk,&#8221; explained Cunningham.
&#8220;You carried the gun, but I doubt you ever
looked it over. Having loaded it once upon a
time, you believed that was sufficient, eh? Know
what I think? The girl has hidden the beads in
her hair. Did you search her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Cleigh shook his head, as much over the
situation as over the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you ran all this risk and hadn&#8217;t the
nerve to search her? Well, that&#8217;s rich! Unless
you&#8217;ve read her from my book. She would
probably have scratched out your eyes. There&#8217;s
an Amazon locked up in that graceful body. I&#8217;d
like to see her head against a bit of clear blue sky&mdash;a
touch of Henner blues and reds. What a whale
of a joke! Abduct a young woman, risk prison,
and then afraid to lay hands on her! You poor old
piker!&#8221; Cunningham laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll be merciful. To make a long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
story short, it means that for the present I am in
command of this yacht. I warned you. Will you
be sensible, or shall I have to lock you up like
your two-gun man from Texas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Piracy!&#8221; cried Cleigh, coming out of his maze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maritime law calls it that, but it isn&#8217;t really.
No pannikins of rum, no fifteen men on a dead
man&#8217;s chest. Parlour stuff, you might call it.
The whole affair&mdash;the parlour side of it&mdash;depends
upon whether you purpose to act philosophically
under stress or kick up a hullabaloo. In the latter
event you may reasonably expect some rough
stuff. Truth is, I&#8217;m only borrowing the yacht
as far as latitude ten degrees and longitude one
hundred and ten degrees, off Catwick Island.
You carry a boson&#8217;s whistle at the end of your
watch chain. Blow it!&#8221; was the challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bid me blow it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to convince you how absolutely helpless
you are,&#8221; said Cunningham, amiably. &#8220;Yesterday
this day&#8217;s madness did prepare, as our old
friend Omar used to say. Vedder did great work on
that, didn&#8217;t he? Toot the whistle, for shortly we
shall weigh anchor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a man in a dream, Cleigh got out his
whistle. The first blast was feeble and windy.
Cunningham grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blow it, man, blow it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>Cleigh set the whistle between his lips and blew
a blast that must have been heard half a mile
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something like! Now we&#8217;ll have results!&#8221;</p>
<p>Above, on deck, came the scuffle of hurrying
feet, and immediately&mdash;as if they had been prepared
against this moment&mdash;three fourths of the
crew came tumbling down the companionway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seize this man!&#8221; shouted Cleigh, thunderously,
as he indicated Cunningham.</p>
<p>The men, however, fell into line and came to
attention. Most of them were grinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear me? Brown, Jessup, McCarthy&mdash;seize
this man!&#8221;</p>
<p>No one stirred. Cleigh then lost his head.
With a growl he sprang toward Cunningham.
Half the crew jumped instantly into the gap between,
and they were no longer grinning. Cunningham
pushed aside the human wall and faced
the <i>Wanderer&#8217;s</i> owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you begin to understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! But whatever your game is, it will prove
bad business for you in the end. And you men,
too. The world has grown mighty small, and
you&#8217;ll find it hard to hide&mdash;unless you kill me and
have done with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut! Wouldn&#8217;t harm a hair of your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
head. The world is small, as you say, but just at
this moment infernally busy mopping up. What,
bother about a little dinkum dinkus like this, with
Russia mad, Germany ugly, France grumbling at
England, Italy shaking her fist at Greece, and
labour making a monkey of itself? Nay! I&#8217;ll
shift the puzzle so you can read it. When the
yacht was released from auxiliary duties she was
without a crew. The old crew, that of peace times,
was gone utterly, with the exception of four. You
had the yacht keelhauled, gave her another daub
of war paint and set about to find a crew. And I
had one especially picked for you! Ordinarily,
you&#8217;ve a tolerably keen eye. Didn&#8217;t it strike you
odd to land a crew who talked more or less grammatically,
who were clean bodily, who weren&#8217;t
boozers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh, fully alive now, coldly ran his inspecting
glance over the men. He had never before given
their faces any particular attention. Besides, this
was the first time he had seen so many of them at
once. During boat drill they had been divided
into four squads. Young faces, lean and hard
some of them, but reckless rather than bad. All
of them at this moment appeared to be enjoying
some huge joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only repeat,&#8221; said Cleigh, &#8220;that you are
all playing with dynamite.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. Most of these boys fought in the
war; they played the game; but when they returned
nobody had any use for them. I caught
them on the rebound, when they were a bit desperate.
We formed a company&mdash;but of that more
anon. Will you be my guest, or will you be my
prisoner?&#8221;</p>
<p>The velvet fell away from Cunningham&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I any choice? I&#8217;ll accept the condition
because I must. But I&#8217;ve warned you. I suppose
I&#8217;d better ask at once what the ransom is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ransom? Not a copper cent! You can make
Singapore in two days from the Catwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And for helping me into Singapore I&#8217;m to agree
not to hand such men as you leave me over to the
British authorities?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All wrong! The men who will help you into
Singapore or take you to Manila will be as innocent
as newborn babes. Wouldn&#8217;t believe it,
would you, but I&#8217;m one of those efficiency sharks.
Nothing left to chance; all cut and dried; pluperfect.
Cleigh, I never break my word. I honestly
intended turning over those beads to you,
but Morrissy muddled the play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next door to murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Near enough, but he&#8217;ll pull out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to take Miss Norman along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, set her ashore to sic the British Navy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
on us? I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t want her on board;
but that was your play, not mine. You tried to
double-cross me. But you need have no alarm. I
will kill the man who touches her. You understand
that, boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>The crew signified that the order was understood,
though one of them&mdash;the returned Flint&mdash;smiled
cynically. If Cunningham noted the smile
he made no verbal comment upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weigh anchor, then! Look alive! The sooner
we nose down to the delta the sooner we&#8217;ll have the
proper sea room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crew scurried off, and almost at once came
familiar sounds&mdash;the rattle of the anchor chain on
the windlass, the creaking of pulley blocks as the
launch came aboard, the thud of feet hither and
yon as portables were stowed or lashed to the
deck-house rail. For several minutes Cleigh and
Cunningham remained speechless and motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get all the angles?&#8221; asked Cunningham,
finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them,&#8221; admitted Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, enough to make you accept a bad
situation with good grace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a foolhardy man, Cunningham. Do
you expect me to lie down when this play is over?
I solemnly swear to you that I&#8217;ll spend the rest of
my days hunting you down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I solemnly swear that you shan&#8217;t catch
me. I&#8217;m through with the old game of playing the
genie in the bottle for predatory millionaires.
Henceforth I&#8217;m on my own. I&#8217;m romantic&mdash;yes,
sir&mdash;I&#8217;m romantic from heel to cowlick; and now
I&#8217;m going to give rein to this stifled longing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come to a halter round your neck. I
have always paid your price on the nail, Cunningham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had to. Hang it, passions are the very
devil, aren&#8217;t they? Sooner or later one jumps
upon your back and rides you like the Old Man of
the Sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh heard the rumble of steam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Objects of art!&#8221; went on Cunningham. &#8220;It
eats into your vitals to hear that some rival has
picked up a Correggio or an ancient Kirman or a
bit of Persian plaque. You talk of halters. Lord
lumme, how obliquely you look at facts! Take
that royal Persian there&mdash;the second-best animal
rug on earth&mdash;is there no murder behind the woof
and warp of it? What? Talk sense, Cleigh, talk
sense! You cable me: Get such and such. I
get it. What the devil do you care how it was got,
so long as it eventually becomes yours? It&#8217;s a
case of the devil biting his own tail&mdash;pot calling
kettle black.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you want?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Cleigh, it&#8217;s the romantic idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you fifty thousand for the rug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. No use now of telling you the plot;
you wouldn&#8217;t believe me, as the song goes. Dinner
at seven. Will you dine in the salon with me,
or will you dine in the solemn grandeur of your own
cabin, in company with Da Vinci, Teniers, and that
Carlo Dolci the Italian Government has been hunting
high and low for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will risk the salon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep an eye on me as long as possible.
That&#8217;s fair enough. You heard what I said to
those boys. Well, every mother&#8217;s son of &#8217;em will
toe the mark. There will be no change at all in
the routine. Simply we lay a new course that
will carry us outside and round Formosa, down to
the South Sea and across to the Catwick. I&#8217;ll
give you one clear idea. A million and immunity
would not stir me, Cleigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game&mdash;if it&#8217;s beyond ransom?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham laughed boyishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big, and you&#8217;ll laugh, too, when I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On which side of the mouth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the rug?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that, of course! I warned you that I&#8217;d
come for the rug. It took two years out of my
young life to get that for you, and it has always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
haunted me. I just told you about passions,
didn&#8217;t I? Once on your back, they ride you like
the devil&mdash;down-hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A crook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again&mdash;pot calling kettle black!
If you want to moralize, where&#8217;s the line between
the thief and the receiver? Fie on you! Dare
you hang that Da Vinci, that Dolci, that Holbein
in your gallery home? No! Stolen goods. What
a passion! You sail across the seas alone, alone
because you can&#8217;t satisfy your passion and have
knowing companions on board. When the yacht
goes out of commission you store the loot, and
tremble when you hear a fire alarm. All right.
Dinner at seven. I&#8217;ll go and liberate your son and
the lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham, I will kill you out of hand the
very first chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old dear, I&#8217;ll add a fact for your comfort.
There will be guns on board, but half an hour
gone all the ammunition was dumped into the
Whangpoo. So you won&#8217;t have anything but
your boson&#8217;s whistle. You&#8217;re a bigger man than I
am physically, and I&#8217;ve a slue-foot, a withered leg;
but I&#8217;ve all the barroom tricks you ever heard of.
So don&#8217;t make any mistakes in that direction.
You are free to come and go as you please; but the
moment you start any rough house, into your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
cabin you go, and you&#8217;ll stay there until we raise
the Catwick. You haven&#8217;t a leg to stand on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham lurched out of the salon and into
the passage. He opened the door to Cabin Two
and turned on the light. Dennison blinked
stupidly. Cunningham liberated him and stood
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner at seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil are you doing on board?&#8221;
asked Dennison, thickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s gratitude for you! But in order
that there will be no misunderstanding, I&#8217;ve turned
to piracy for a change. Great sport! I&#8217;ve chartered
the yacht for a short cruise.&#8221; His banter
turned into cold, precise tones. Cunningham
went on: &#8220;No nonsense, captain! I put this
crew on board away back in New York. Those
beads, though having a merit of their own, were
the lure to bring your father to these parts.
Your presence and Miss Norman&#8217;s are accidents
for which I am genuinely sorry. But frankly, I
dare not turn you loose. That&#8217;s the milk in the
cocoanut. I grant you the same privileges as I
grant your father, which he has philosophically
agreed to accept. Your word of honour to take it
sensibly, and the freedom of the yacht is yours.
Otherwise, I&#8217;ll lock you up in a place not half so
comfortable as this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Piracy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. These are strangely troubled days.
We&#8217;ve slumped morally. Humanity has been
on the big kill, with the result that the tablets
of Moses have been busted up something fierce.
And here we are again, all kotowing to the
Golden Calf! All I need is your word&mdash;the word
of a Cleigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give it.&#8221; Dennison gave his word so that he
might be free to protect the girl in the adjoining
cabin. &#8220;But conditionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That the young lady shall at all times be
treated with the utmost respect. You will have to
kill me otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These Cleighs! All right. That happens to
be my own order to the crew. Any man who
breaks it will pay heavily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game?&#8221; asked Dennison, rubbing
his wrists tenderly while he balanced unsteadily
upon his aching legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Later! I&#8217;ll let Miss Norman out. That&#8217;s so&mdash;her
things are in the salon. I&#8217;ll get them, but
I&#8217;ll unlock her door first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in heaven&#8217;s name has happened?&#8221; asked
Jane as she and Dennison stood alone in the passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord knows!&#8221; gloomily. &#8220;But that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
scoundrel Cunningham has planted a crew of his
own on board, and we are all prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chap with the limp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the handsome face? But this is piracy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About the size of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew something was going to happen!
But a pirate! Surely it must be a joke?&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was&mdash;probably the most colossal joke that
ever flowered in the mind of a man. The devil
must have shouted and the gods must have held
their sides, for it took either a devil or a god to
understand the joke.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p>That first dinner would always remain
vivid and clear-cut in Jane Norman&#8217;s
mind. It was fantastic. To begin with,
there was that picturesque stone image at the
head of the table&mdash;Cleigh&mdash;who appeared utterly
oblivious of his surroundings, who ate with apparent
relish, and who ignored both men, his son and
his captor. Once or twice Jane caught his glance&mdash;a
blue eye, sharp-pupiled, agate-hard. But
what was it she saw&mdash;a twinkle or a sparkle? The
breadth of his shoulders! He must be very
powerful, like the son. Why, the two of them
could have pulverized this pretty fellow opposite!</p>
<p>Father and son! For seven years they had not
met. Their indifference seemed so inhuman! Still,
she fancied that the son dared not make any
approach, however much he may have longed to.
A woman! They had quarrelled over a woman!
Something reached down from the invisible and
pinched her heart.</p>
<p>All this while Cunningham had been talking&mdash;banter.
The blade would flash toward the father
or whirl upon the son, or it would come toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
her by the handle. She could not get away from
the initial idea&mdash;that his eyes were like fire opals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman, you have very beautiful hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like Judith&#8217;s. You remember, Cleigh,
the one that hangs in the Pitti Galleria in Florence&mdash;Allori&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh reached for a piece of bread, which he
broke and buttered.</p>
<p>Cunningham turned to Jane again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you do me the favour of taking out the
hairpins and loosing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Jane, smiling bravely enough,
though there ran over her spine a chill.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t Cunningham&#8217;s request&mdash;it was Dennison&#8217;s
refusal. That syllable, though spoken moderately,
was the essence of battle, murder, and sudden
death. If they should clash it would mean
that Denny&mdash;how easy it was to call him that!&mdash;Denny
would be locked up and she would be all
alone. For the father seemed as aloof and remote
as the pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall not do it!&#8221; declared Dennison.
&#8220;Cunningham, if you force her I will break every
bone in your body here and now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh selected an olive and began munching it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried Jane. &#8220;It&#8217;s all awry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
anyhow.&#8221; And she began to extract the hairpins.
Presently she shook her head, and the ruddy mass
of hair fell and rippled across and down her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, looking whimsically into
Cunningham&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t there, was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>This tickled Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a woman in a million! You read my
thought perfectly. I like ready wit in a woman.
I had to find out. You see, I had promised those
beads to Cleigh, and when I humanly can I keep
my promises. Sit down, captain!&#8221; For Dennison
had risen to his feet. &#8220;Sit down! Don&#8217;t
start anything you can&#8217;t finish.&#8221; To Jane there
was in the tone a quality which made her compare
it with the elder Cleigh&#8217;s eyes&mdash;agate-hard. &#8220;You
are younger and stronger, and no doubt you could
break me. But the moment my hand is withdrawn
from this business&mdash;the moment I am off
the board&mdash;I could not vouch for the crew. They
are more or less decent chaps, or they were before
this damned war stood humanity on its head.
We wear the same clothes, use the same phrases;
but we&#8217;ve been thrust back a thousand years.
And Miss Norman is a woman. You understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better kill me somewhere along this
voyage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I may have to. Who knows? There&#8217;s no
real demarcation between comedy and tragedy;
it&#8217;s the angle of vision. It&#8217;s rough medicine,
this; but your father has agreed to take it sensibly,
because he knows me tolerably well. Still, it will
not do him any good to plan bribery. Buy the
crew, Cleigh, if you believe you can. You&#8217;ll waste
your time. I do not pretend to hold them by
loyalty. I hold them by fear. Act sensibly, all
of you, and this will be a happy family. For after
all, it&#8217;s a joke, a whale of a joke. And some day
you&#8217;ll smile over it&mdash;even you, Cleigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh pressed the steward&#8217;s button.</p>
<p>&#8220;The jam and the cheese, Togo,&#8221; he said to the
Jap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yess, sair!&#8221;</p>
<p>A hysterical laugh welled into Jane&#8217;s throat, but
she did not permit it to escape her lips. She began
to build up her hair clumsily, because her hands
trembled.</p>
<p>Adventure! She thrilled! She had read somewhere
that after seven thousand years of tortuous
windings human beings had formed about themselves
a thin shell which they called civilization.
And always someone was breaking through and
retracing those seven thousand years. Here was
an example in Cunningham. Only a single step
was necessary. It took seven thousand years to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
build your shell, and only a minute to destroy it.
There was something fascinating in the thought.
A reckless spirit pervaded Jane, a longing to burst
through this shell of hers and ride the thunderbolt.
Monotony&mdash;that had been her portion, and only
her dreams had kept her from withering. From
the house to the hospital and back home again,
days, weeks, years. She had begun to hate white;
her soul thirsted for colour, movement, thrill.
The call that had been walled in, suppressed,
broke through. Piracy on high seas, and Jane
Norman in the cast!</p>
<p>She was not in the least afraid of the whimsical
rogue opposite. He was more like an uninvited
dinner guest. Perhaps this lack of fear had its
origin in the oily smoothness by which the yacht
had changed hands. Beyond the subjugation of
Dodge, there had not been a ripple of commotion.
It was too early to touch the undercurrents. All
this lulled and deceived her. Piracy? Where
were the cutlasses, the fierce moustaches, the red
bandannas, the rattle of dice, and the drunken
songs?&mdash;the piracy of tradition? If she had any
fear at all it was for the man at her left&mdash;Denny&mdash;who
might run amuck on her account and spoil
everything. All her life she would hear the father&#8217;s
voice&mdash;&#8220;The jam and the cheese, Togo.&#8221; What
men, all three of them!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>Cunningham laid his napkin on the table and
stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolute personal liberty, if you will accept
the situation sensibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison glowered at him, but Jane reached out
and touched the soldier&#8217;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For your sake, then. But it&#8217;s tough medicine
for me to swallow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure it is,&#8221; agreed the rogue. &#8220;Look
upon me as a supercargo for the next ten days.
You&#8217;ll see me only at lunch and dinner. I&#8217;ve a lot
of work to do in the chart house. By the way, the
wireless man is mine, Cleigh, so don&#8217;t waste any
time on him. Hope you&#8217;re a good sailor, Miss
Norman, for we are heading into rough weather,
and we haven&#8217;t much beam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it, you and I shan&#8217;t have any trouble!
Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham limped to the door, where he
turned and eyed the elder Cleigh, who was stirring
his coffee thoughtfully. Suddenly the rogue burst
into a gale of laughter, and they could hear recurrent
bursts as he wended his way to the companion.</p>
<p>When this sound died away Cleigh turned his
glance levelly upon Jane. The stone-like mask
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
dissolved into something that was pathetically
human.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
we are heading into, but if we ever get clear I will
make any reparation you may demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any kind of a reparation?&#8221;&mdash;an eager note in
her voice.</p>
<p>Dennison stared at her, puzzled, but almost
instantly he was conscious of the warmth of
shame in his cheeks. This girl wasn&#8217;t that sort&mdash;to
ask for money as a balm for the indignity offered
her. What was she after?</p>
<p>&#8220;Any kind of reparation,&#8221; repeated Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember that&mdash;if we get through. And
somehow I believe we shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You trust that scoundrel?&#8221; asked Cleigh,
astonishedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inexplicably&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he happens to be handsome?&#8221;&mdash;with
frank irony.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; But she looked at the son as she spoke.
&#8220;He said he never broke his word. No man can
be a very great villain who can say that. Did he
ever break his word to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except in this instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite confident he knows where they
are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are they so precious? What makes them
precious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you&mdash;they are love beads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rank nonsense! I&#8217;m no child!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t love rank nonsense?&#8221; Cleigh countered.
He was something of a banterer himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you never loved anybody?&#8221; she shot
back at him.</p>
<p>A shadow passed over the man&#8217;s face, clearing
the ironic expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I loved not wisely but too well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry! I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are young; all about you is sunshine; I myself
have gone down among the shadows. Cunningham
may keep his word; but there is always
the possibility of his not being able to keep it. He
has become an outlaw; he is in maritime law a
pirate. The crew are aware of it; prison stares
them in the face, and that may make them reckless.
If you weren&#8217;t on board I shouldn&#8217;t care.
But you are young, vital, attractive, of the type
that appeals to strong men. In the dry stores
there are many cases of liquor and wine. The
men may break into the stuff before we reach the
Catwick. That will take ten or twelve days if
Cunningham lays a course outside Formosa.
What&#8217;s his game? I don&#8217;t know. Probably he
will maroon us on the Catwick, an island I know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
nothing about, except that it is nearer to Saigon
than to Singapore. So then in the daytime stay
where I am or where Captain Dennison is. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison balanced his spoon on the rim of the
coffee cup&mdash;not a particularly easy job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever shall I do with the jade?&#8221; Jane
asked, irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The jade necklace. That poor Chinaman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ling Foo? I wish I had broken his infernal
yellow neck! But for him neither of us would be
here. But he is right,&#8221; Dennison added, with a
jerk of his head toward the door. &#8220;You must always
be with one or the other of us&mdash;preferably
me.&#8221; He smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you promise me one thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you promise me one thing, Denny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is not to attempt to mix it with the
scoundrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise&mdash;so long as he keeps his. But if he
touches you&mdash;well, God help him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And me! Oh, I don&#8217;t mean him. It is you
that I am afraid of. You&#8217;re so terribly strong&mdash;and&mdash;and
so heady. I can never forget how you
went into that mob of quarrelling troopers. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
you were an officer there; your uniform doesn&#8217;t
count here. If only you and your father stood
together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do so far as you are concerned. Never
doubt that. Otherwise, though, it&#8217;s hopeless.
What are you going to demand of him&mdash;supposing
we come through safely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my secret. Let&#8217;s go on deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s raining hard, and there&#8217;ll be a good deal of
pitching shortly. Better turn in. You&#8217;ve been
through enough to send the average woman into
hysterics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be possible to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I grant that, but I&#8217;d rather you would go at
once to your cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you will understand. I&#8217;m not
really afraid. I know I ought to be, but I&#8217;m not.
All my life has been a series of humdrum&mdash;and
here is adventure, stupendous adventure!&#8221; She
rose abruptly, holding out her arms dramatically
toward space. &#8220;All my life I have lived in a shell,
and chance has cracked it. If only you knew how
wonderfully free I feel at this moment! I want
to go on deck, to feel the wind and the rain in my
face!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to bed,&#8221; he said, prosaically.</p>
<p>Though never had she appeared so poignantly
desirable. He wanted to seize her in his arms,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
smother her with kisses, bury his face in her hair.
And swiftly upon this desire came the thought that
if she appealed to him so strongly, might she not
appeal quite as strongly to the rogue? He laid
the spoon on the rim of the cup again and teetered
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to bed,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;An order?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An order. I&#8217;ll go along with you to the cabin.
Come!&#8221; He got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me you&#8217;re not excited?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honestly terrified. I&#8217;d give ten years of
my life if you were safely out of this. For seven
long years I have been knocking about this world,
and among other things I have learned that plans
like Cunningham&#8217;s never get through per order.
I don&#8217;t know what the game is, but it&#8217;s bound to
fail. So I&#8217;m going to ask you, in God&#8217;s name, not
to let any romantical ideas get into your head.
This is bad business for all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something in his voice, aside from
the genuine seriousness, that subdued her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to bed. Shall we have breakfast together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>To reach the port passage they had to come out
into the main salon. Cleigh was in his corner
reading.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she called. All her bitterness
toward him was gone. &#8220;And don&#8217;t worry about
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; replied Cleigh over the top of the
book. &#8220;Be sure of your door. If you hear any
untoward sounds in the night call to the captain
whose cabin adjoins yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she and Dennison arrived at the door of
her cabin she turned impulsively and gave him
both her hands. He held them lightly, because
his emotions were at full tide, and he did not care
to have her sense it in any pressure. Her confidence
in him now was absolute, and he must
guard himself constantly. Poor fool! Why hadn&#8217;t
he told her that last night on the British transport?
What had held him back?</p>
<p>The uncertain future&mdash;he had let that rise up
between. And now he could not tell her. If she
did not care, if her regard did not go beyond comradeship,
the knowledge would only distress her.</p>
<p>The yacht was beginning to roll now, for they
were making the East China Sea. The yacht
rolled suddenly to starboard, and Jane fell against
him. He caught her, instantly turned her right
about and gently but firmly forced her into the
cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night. Remember! Rap on the partition
if you hear anything you don&#8217;t like.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she had locked and latched the door she
set about the business of emptying her kit bags.
She hung the evening gown she had worn all day
in the locker, laid her toilet articles on the dresser,
and set the brass hand warmer on the lowboy.
Then she let down her hair and began to brush it.
She swung a thick strand of it over her shoulder
and ran her hand down under it. The woman in
&#8220;Phra the Ph&oelig;nician,&#8221; Allori&#8217;s Judith&mdash;and she
had always hated the colour of it! She once more
applied the brush, balancing herself nicely to meet
the ever-increasing roll.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she did feel free, freer than she had
felt in all her life before. A stupendous adventure!
After the braids were completed she flung them
down her back, turned off the light, and peered out
of the rain-blurred port. She could see nothing
except an occasional flash of angry foam as it
raced past. She slipped into bed, but her eyes
remained open for a long time.</p>
<p>Dennison wondered if there would be a slicker
in his old locker. He opened the door. He
found an oilskin and a yellow sou&#8217;wester on the
hooks. He took them down and put them on
and stole out carefully, a hand extended each side
to minimize the roll. He navigated the passage
and came out into the salon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Cleigh was still immersed in his book. He
looked up quickly, but recognizing the intruder,
dropped his gaze instantly. Dennison crossed the
salon to the companionway and staggered up the
steps. Had his father ever really been afraid of
anything? He could not remember ever having
seen the old boy in the grip of fear. What a
devil of a world it was!</p>
<p>Dennison was an able seaman. He had been
brought up on the sea&mdash;seven years on the first
<i>Wanderer</i> and five on the second. He had, in
company with his father, ridden the seven seas.
But he had no trade; he hadn&#8217;t the money instinct;
he would have to stumble upon fortune; he knew
no way of making it. And this knowledge stirred
his rancor anew&mdash;the father hadn&#8217;t played fair
with the son.</p>
<p>He gripped the deck-house rail to steady himself,
for the wind and rain caught him head-on.</p>
<p>Then he worked his way slowly along to the
bridge. Twice a comber broke on the quarter and
dropped a ton of water, which sloshed about the
deck, drenching his feet. He climbed the ladder,
rather amused at the recurrence of an old thought&mdash;that
climbing ship ladders in dirty weather
was a good deal like climbing in nightmares: one
weighed thousands of pounds and had feet of lead.</p>
<p>Presently he peered into the chart room, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
was dark except for the small hooded bulbs over
the navigating instruments. He could see the
chin and jaws of the wheelman and the beard of
old Captain Newton. From time to time a wheel
spoke came into the light.</p>
<p>On the chart table lay a pocket lamp, facing
sternward, the light pouring upon what looked to
be a map; and over it were bent three faces, one
of which was Cunningham&#8217;s. A forefinger was
tracing this map.</p>
<p>Dennison opened the door and stepped inside.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;How are you making out, Newton?&#8221; he
asked, calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny? Why, God bless me, boy,
I&#8217;m glad to see you! How&#8217;s your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be like him. I don&#8217;t suppose if
hell opened under his feet he&#8217;d do anything except
look interested. And it &#8217;pears to me&#8217;s though hell
had opened up right now!&#8221;</p>
<p>A chuckle came from the chart table.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your idea of hell, Newton?&#8221; asked
Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything you might have a hand in,&#8221; was the
return bolt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you used to like me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! But I didn&#8217;t know you then. The
barometer&#8217;s dropping. If it was August I&#8217;d say
we were nosing into a typhoon. I always hated
this yellow muck they call a sea over here. Did
you pick up that light?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered the wheelman. &#8220;I take
it she&#8217;s making south&mdash;Hong-Kong way. There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
plenty of sea room. She&#8217;ll be well down before we
cross her wake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence except for the rumble of the weather
canvas standing up against the furious blasts of
the wind. Dennison stepped over to the chart
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham, I would like to have a word with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead. You can have as many as you
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At dinner you spoke of your word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I did. What about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you keep it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever I humanly can. Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this Catwick Island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hanged if I know!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to maroon us there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. At that point the yacht will be turned
back to your father, and he can cruise until the
crack o&#8217; doom without further interference from
yours truly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;and I will keep it. Anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I will play the game as it lies, provided
that Miss Norman is in nowise interfered with
or annoyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is she taking it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My reply first.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Neither I nor the crew will bother her. She
shall come and go free as the gull in the air. If at
any time the men do not observe the utmost politeness
toward her you will do me a favour to report
to me. That&#8217;s my word, and I promise to
keep it, even if I have to kill a man or two. I wish
to come through clean in the hands so far as your
father, Miss Norman, and yourself are concerned.
I&#8217;m risking my neck and my liberty, for this is
piracy on the high seas. But every man is
entitled to one good joke during his lifetime, and
when we raise the Catwick I&#8217;ll explain this joke
in full. If you don&#8217;t chuckle, then you haven&#8217;t
so much as a grain of humour in your make-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing for me to do but take
your word as you give it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk. Now, Flint, this bay
or lagoon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice dropped into a low, indistinguishable
murmur. Dennison realized that the moment had
come to depart; the edge of the encounter was in
Cunningham&#8217;s favour and to remain would only
serve to sharpen this edge. So he went outside,
slamming the door behind him.</p>
<p>The word of a rogue! There was now nothing
to do but turn in. He believed he had a glimmer.
Somewhere off the Catwick Cunningham and his
crew were to be picked up. He would not be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
going to the Catwick himself, not knowing whether
it was jungle or bald rock. But if a ship was to
pick him up, why hadn&#8217;t she made Shanghai and
picked him up there? Why commit piracy&mdash;unless
he was a colossal liar, which Dennison was
ready enough to believe. The word of a rogue!</p>
<p>Some private war? Was Cunningham paying
off an old grudge? But was any grudge worth
this risk? The old boy wasn&#8217;t to be scared;
Cunningham ought to have known that. If
Cleigh came through with a whole skin he&#8217;d hunt
the beggar down if it carried him to the North
Pole. Cunningham ought to have known that,
too. A planted crew, piracy&mdash;and he, Dennison
Cleigh, was eventually to chuckle over it! He
had his doubts. And where did the glass beads
come in? Or had Cunningham spoken the truth&mdash;a
lure? A big game somewhere in the offing.
And the rogue was right! The world, dizzily
stewing in a caldron of monumental mistakes,
would give scant attention to an off-side play such
as this promised to be. Not a handhold anywhere
to the puzzle. The old boy might have the key,
but Dennison Cleigh could not go to him for the
solution.</p>
<p>His own father! Just as he had become used
to the idea that the separation was final, absolute,
to be thrown together in this fantastic manner!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
The father&#8217;s arm under his neck and the cup at his
lips had shaken him profoundly. But Cleigh
would not have denied a dog drink had the dog
exhibited signs of thirst. So nothing could be
drawn from that.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Morning. Jane opened her eyes, only to shut
them quickly. The white brilliancy of the cabin
hurt. Across the ceiling ran a constant flicker of
silver&mdash;reflected sunshine on the water. Southward&mdash;they
were heading southward. She jumped
out of bed and stepped over to the port. Flashing
yellow water, a blue sky, and far off the oddly
ribbed sails of a Chinese junk labouring heavily in
the big sea that was still running. Glorious!</p>
<p>She dressed hurriedly and warmly, bundling
her hair under a velours hat and ramming a pin
through both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny?&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>There was no answer. He was on deck, probably.</p>
<p>An odd scene awaited her in the main salon.
Cleigh, senior, stood before the phonograph listening
to Caruso. The roll of the yacht in nowise
disturbed the mechanism of the instrument.
There was no sudden sluing of the needle, due to an
amateurish device which Cleigh himself had constructed.
The son, stooping, was searching the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
titles of a row of new novels. The width of the
salon stretched between the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a joyousness in her voice she made
not the least attempt to conceal. She was joyous,
alive, and she did not care who knew it.</p>
<p>Dennison acknowledged her greeting with a
smile, a smile which was a mixture of wonder and
admiration. How in the world was she to be
made to understand that they were riding a deep-sea
volcano?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing disturbed you through the night?&#8221;
asked Cleigh, lifting the pin from the record.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I lay awake for an hour or two, but
after that I slept like a log. Have I kept you
waiting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Breakfast isn&#8217;t quite ready,&#8221; answered
Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes the sea so yellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the big Chinese rivers are mud-banked and
mud-bottomed. They pour millions of tons of
yellow mud into these waters. By this afternoon,
however, I imagine we&#8217;ll be nosing into the blue.
Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast iss served,&#8221; announced Togo the
Jap.</p>
<p>The trio entered the dining salon in single file,
and once more Jane found herself seated between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
the two men. One moment she was carrying on
a conversation with the father, the next moment
with the son. The two ignored each other perfectly.
Under ordinary circumstances it would
have been strange enough; but in this hour, when
no one knew where or how this voyage would end!
A real tragedy or some absurd trifle? Probably a
trifle; trifles dug more pits than tragedies. Perhaps
tragedy was mis-named. What humans
called tragedy was epic, and trifles were real
tragedies. And then there were certain natures
to whom the trifle was epical; to whom the inconsequent
was invariably magnified nine diameters;
and having made a mistake, would die
rather than admit it.</p>
<p>To bring these two together, to lure them from
behind their ramparts of stubbornness, to see
them eventually shake hands and grin as men will
who recognize that they have been playing the
fool! She became fired with the idea. Only
she must not move prematurely; there must arrive
some psychological moment.</p>
<p>During the meal, toward the end of it, one of the
crew entered. He was young&mdash;in the early
twenties. The manner in which he saluted convinced
Dennison that the fellow had recently been
in the United States Navy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s compliments, sir. Canvas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
has been rigged on the port promenade and chairs
and rugs set out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another salute and he was off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s decent enough,&#8221; was Dennison&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;That chap has been in the Navy.
It&#8217;s all miles over my head, I&#8217;ll confess. Cunningham
spoke of a joke when I accosted him in the
chart house last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You went up there?&#8221; cried Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And among other things he said that
every man is entitled to at least one good joke.
What the devil can he mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Had he been looking at his father Dennison
would have caught a fleeting, grim, shadowy smile
on the strong mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find a dozen new novels on the shelves,
Miss Norman,&#8221; said Cleigh as he rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
on deck. I generally walk two or three miles in
the morning. Let us hang together this day to
test the scalawag&#8217;s promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cleigh, when you spoke of reparation last
night, you weren&#8217;t thinking in monetary terms,
were you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh&#8217;s brows lowered a trifle, but it was the
effect of puzzlement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she proceeded, gravely, &#8220;all the
money you possess would not compensate me for
the position you have placed me in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps I did have money in mind. However,
I hold to my word. Anything you may ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day I will ask you for something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if humanly possible I promise to give it,&#8221;
and with this Cleigh took leave.</p>
<p>Jane turned to Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so strange and incomprehensible! You
two sitting here and ignoring each other! Surely
you don&#8217;t hate your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the greatest respect and admiration for
him. To you no doubt it seems fantastic; but we
understand each other thoroughly, my father and
I. I&#8217;d take his hand instantly, God knows, if he
offered it! But if I offered mine it would be glass
against diamond&mdash;I&#8217;d only get badly scratched.
Suppose we go on deck? The air and the sunshine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this catastrophe has brought you together
after all these years. Isn&#8217;t there something providential
in that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can say?&#8221;</p>
<p>On deck they fell in behind Cleigh, and followed
him round for fully an hour; then Jane signified
that she was tired, and Dennison put her in the
centre chair and wrapped the rug about her. He
selected the chair at her right.</p>
<p>Jane shut her eyes, and Dennison opened a
novel. It was good reading, and he became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
partially absorbed. The sudden creak of a chair
brought his glance round. His father had seated
himself in the vacant chair.</p>
<p>The phase that dug in and hurt was that his
father made no endeavour to avoid him&mdash;simply
ignored his existence. Seven years and not a
crack in the granite! He laid the book on his
knees and stared at the rocking horizon.</p>
<p>One of the crew passed. Cleigh hailed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send Mr. Cleve to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air and the tone of the man were perfectly
respectful.</p>
<p>When Cleve, the first officer, appeared his manner
was solicitous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you comfortable, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would ten thousand dollars interest you?&#8221; said
Cleigh, directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean to come over to your side, no.
My life wouldn&#8217;t be worth a snap of the thumb.
You know something about Dick Cunningham.
I know him well. The truth is, Mr. Cleigh, we&#8217;re
off on a big gamble, and if we win out ten thousand
wouldn&#8217;t interest me. Life on board will be
exactly as it was before you put into Shanghai.
More I am not at liberty to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is the Catwick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere round two thousand&mdash;eight or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
nine days, perhaps ten. We&#8217;re not piling on&mdash;short
of coal. It&#8217;s mighty difficult to get it for a
private yacht. You may not find a bucketful in
Singapore. In America you can always commandeer
it, having ships and coal mines of your
own. The drop down to Singapore from the Catwick
is about forty hours. You have coal in
Manila. You can cable for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are honestly leaving us at that island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. You can, if you wish, take the run
up to Saigon; but your chance for coal there is
nil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleve,&#8221; said Cleigh, solemnly, &#8220;you appreciate
the risks you are running?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cleigh, there are no risks. It&#8217;s a dead
certainty. Cunningham is one of your efficiency
experts. Everything has been thought of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except fate,&#8221; supplemented Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate? Why, she&#8217;s our chief engineer!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleve turned away, chuckling; a dozen feet off
this chuckle became boisterous laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can they be after? Sunken treasure?&#8221;
cried Jane, excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hangman&#8217;s hemp&mdash;if I live long enough,&#8221;
was the grim declaration, and Cleigh drew the rug
over his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it can&#8217;t be anything dreadful if they can
laugh over it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear Mephisto laugh in Faust?
Cunningham is a queer duck. I don&#8217;t suppose
there&#8217;s a corner on the globe he hasn&#8217;t had a peek
at. He has a vast knowledge of the arts. His
real name nobody seems to know. He can make
himself very likable to men and attractive to
women. The sort of women he seeks do not mind
his physical deformity. His face and his intellect
draw them, and he is as cruel as a wolf. It never
occurred to me until last night that men like me
create his kind. But I don&#8217;t understand him in
this instance. A play like this, with all the future
risks! After I get the wires moving he won&#8217;t be
able to stir a hundred miles in any direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But so long as he doesn&#8217;t intend to harm us&mdash;and
I&#8217;m convinced he doesn&#8217;t&mdash;perhaps we&#8217;d better
play the game as he asks us to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman,&#8221; said Cleigh in a tired voice,
&#8220;will you do me the favour to ask Captain Dennison
why he has never touched the twenty thousand
I deposited to his account?&#8221;</p>
<p>Astonished, Jane turned to Dennison to repeat
the question, but was forestalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Mr. Cleigh that to touch a dollar of that
money would be a tacit admission that Mr. Cleigh
had the right to strike Captain Dennison across
the mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison swung out of the chair and strode off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
toward the bridge, his shoulders flat and his neck
stiff.</p>
<p>&#8220;You struck him?&#8221; demanded Jane, impulsively.</p>
<p>But Cleigh did not answer. His eyes were
closed, his head rested against the back of the chair
so Jane did not press the question. It was enough
that she had seen behind a corner of this peculiar
veil. And, oddly, she felt quite as much pity
for the father as for the son. A wall of pride,
Alpine high, and neither would force a passage!</p>
<p>They did not see the arch rogue during the day,
but he came in to dinner. He was gay&mdash;in a
story-telling mood. There was little or no banter,
for he spoke only to Jane, and gave her flashes of
some of his amazing activities in search of art
treasures. He had once been chased up and down
Japan by the Mikado&#8217;s agents for having in his
possession some royal-silk tapestry which it is
forbidden to take out of the country. Another
time he had gone into Tibet for a lama&#8217;s ghost
mask studded with raw emeralds and turquoise,
and had suffered untold miseries in getting down
into India. Again he had entered a Rajput haremlik
as a woman, and eventually escaped with the
fabulous rug which hung in the salon. Adventure,
adventure, and death always at his elbow! There
was nothing of the braggart in the man; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
recounted his tales after the manner of a boy relating
some college escapades, deprecatingly.</p>
<p>Often Jane stole a glance at one or the other of
the Cleighs. She was constantly swung between&mdash;but
never touched&mdash;the desire to laugh and the
desire to weep over this tragedy, which seemed so
futile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you write a book about these
adventures?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;A book? No time,&#8221; said Cunningham. &#8220;Besides,
the moment one of these trips is over it ends;
I can recount it only sketchily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But even sketchily it would be tremendously
interesting. It is as if you were playing a game
with death for the mere sport of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that hits it, though I&#8217;ve never stopped
to analyze. I never think of death; it is a waste
of gray matter. I should be no nearer death in
Tibet than I should be asleep in a cradle. Why
bother about the absolute, the inevitable? Humanity
wears itself out building bridges for
imaginary torrents. I am an exception; that is why
I shall be young and handsome up to the moment
the grim stalker puts his claw on my shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you, have you never caught some of the
passion for possessing rare paintings, rugs, manuscripts?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You miss the point. What does the sense of
possession amount to beside the sense of seeking
and finding? Cleigh here thinks he is having a
thrill when he signs a check. It is to laugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever killed a man?&#8221; It was one of
those questions that leap forth irresistibly. Jane
was a bit frightened at her temerity.</p>
<p>Cunningham drank his coffee deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane shrank back a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;But never willfully,&#8221; Cunningham added&mdash;&#8220;always
in self-defence, and never a white man.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a peculiar phase about the man&#8217;s
singular beauty. Animated, it was youthful; in
grim repose, it was sad and old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Death!&#8221; said Jane in a kind of awed whisper.
&#8220;I have watched many die, and I cannot get over
the terror of it. Here is a man with all the faculties,
physical and mental; a human being, loving,
hating, working, sleeping; and in an instant he is
nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Chinaman once said that the thought of
death is as futile as water in the hand. By the
way, Cleigh&mdash;and you too, captain&mdash;give the wireless
a wide berth. There&#8217;s death there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane saw the fire opals leap into the dark eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p>The third day out they were well below
Formosa, which had been turned on a wide
arc. The sea was blue now, quiescent,
waveless; there was only the eternal roll. Still
Jane could not help comparing the sea with the
situation&mdash;the devil was slumbering. What if he
waked?</p>
<p>Time after time she tried to force her thoughts
into the reality of this remarkable cruise, but it was
impossible. Romance was always smothering her,
edging her off, when she approached the sinister.
Perhaps if she had heard ribald songs, seen evidence
of drunkenness; if the crew had loitered
about and been lacking in respect, she would have
been able to grasp the actuality; but so far the idea
persisted that this could not be anything more
than a pleasure cruise. Piracy? Where was it?</p>
<p>So she measured her actions accordingly, read,
played the phonograph, went here and there over
the yacht, often taking her stand in the bow and
peering down the cutwater to watch the antics of
some humorous porpoise or to follow the smother of
spray where the flying fish broke. In fact, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
conducted herself exactly as she would have done
on board a passenger ship. There were moments
when she was honestly bored.</p>
<p>Piracy! This was an established fact. Cunningham
and his men had stepped outside the pale
of law in running off with the <i>Wanderer</i>. But
piracy without drunken disorder, piracy that wiped
its feet on the doormat and hung its hat on the
rack! There was a touch of the true farce in it.
Hadn&#8217;t Cunningham himself confessed that the
whole affair was a joke?</p>
<p>Round two o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of the third
day Jane, for the moment alone in her chair, heard
the phonograph&mdash;the sextet from Lucia. She
left her chair, looked down through the open
transom and discovered Dennison cranking the
machine. He must have seen her shadow, for he
glanced up quickly.</p>
<p>He crooked a finger which said, &#8220;Come on
down!&#8221; She made a negative sign and withdrew
her head.</p>
<p>Here she was again on the verge of wild laughter.
Donizetti! Pirates! Glass beads for which
Cleigh had voyaged sixteen thousand miles! A
father and son who ignored each other! She
choked down this desire to laugh, because she was
afraid it might end suddenly in hysteria and tears.
She returned to her chair, and there was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
father arranging himself comfortably. He had a
book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like me to read a while to you?&#8221;
she offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you? You see,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;I&#8217;m
troubled with insomnia. If I read by myself I only
become interested in the book, but if someone
reads aloud it makes me drowsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a nurse I&#8217;ve done that hundreds of times.
But frankly, I can&#8217;t read poetry; I begin to sing-song
it at once; it becomes rime without reason.
What is the book?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh extended it to her. The moment her
hands touched the volume she saw that she was
holding something immeasurably precious. The
form was unlike the familiar shapes of modern
books. The covers consisted of exquisitely hand-tooled
calf bound by thongs; there was a subtle
perfume as she opened them. Illuminated vellum.
She uttered a pleasurable little gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Song of Songs, which is Solomon&#8217;s,&#8221; she
read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteenth century&mdash;the vellum. The Florentine
covers were probably added in the seventeenth.
I have four more downstairs. They are
museum pieces, as we say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is to say, priceless?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a fashion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Many waters cannot quench love, neither can
the floods drown it; if a man would give all the
substance of his house for love, it would utterly be
contemned!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you select that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t select it; I remembered it&mdash;because
it is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a very pleasant voice. Go on&mdash;read.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus for an hour she read to him, and by the
time she grew tired Cleigh was sound asleep. The
look of granite was gone from his face, and she
saw that he, too, had been handsome in his youth.
Why had he struck Denny on the mouth? What
had the son done so to enrage the father? Some
woman! And where had she met the man? Oh,
she was certain that she had encountered him before!
But for the present the gate to recollection
refused to swing outward. Gently she laid the
beautiful book on his knees and stole over to the
rail. For a while she watched the flying fish.</p>
<p>Then came one of those impulses which keep
human beings from becoming half gods&mdash;a wrong
impulse, surrendered to immediately, unweighed,
unanalyzed, unchallenged. The father asleep, the
son amusing himself with the phonograph, she
was now unobserved by her guardians; and so she
put into execution the thought that had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
urging and intriguing her since the strange voyage
began&mdash;a visit to the chart house. She wanted
to ask Cunningham some questions. He would
know something about the Cleighs.</p>
<p>The port door to the chart house was open,
latched back against the side. She hesitated for
a moment outside the high-beamed threshold&mdash;hesitated
because Captain Newton was not visible.
The wheelman was alone. Obliquely she saw
Cunningham, Cleve, and a third man seated round
a table which was littered. This third man sat
facing the port door, and sensing her presence he
looked up. Rather attractive until one noted the
thin, hard lips, the brilliant blue eyes. At the
sight of Jane something flitted over his face, and
Jane knew that he was bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Flint?&#8221; asked Cunningham,
observing the other&#8217;s abstraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a visitor,&#8221; answered Flint.</p>
<p>Cunningham spun his chair round and jumped
to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman? Come in, come in! Anything
you need?&#8221; he asked with lively interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to ask you some questions, Mr.
Cunningham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Well, if I can answer them, I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked significantly at his companions, who
rose and left the house by the starboard door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t keep away from him, can they?&#8221;
said Flint, cynically. &#8220;Slue-Foot has the come-hither,
sure enough. I had an idea she&#8217;d be hiking
this way the first chance she got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t the right dope this trip,&#8221; replied
Cleve. &#8220;The contract reads: Hands off women
and booze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Psalm-singing pirates! We&#8217;ll be having
prayers Sunday. But that woman is my style.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better begin digging up a prayer if you&#8217;ve got
that bug in your head. If you make any fool
play in that direction Cunningham will break you.
I saw you last night staring through the transom.
Watch your step, Flint. I&#8217;m telling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if she should happen to take a fancy to
me, who shall say no?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate yourself, eh? There was liquor on your
breath last night. Did you bring some aboard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a whole lot to me, my bucko&mdash;to me and to
the rest of the boys. Cleigh will not prosecute us
for piracy if we play a decent game until we raise
the Catwick. On old Van Dorn&#8217;s tub we can
drink and sing if we want to. If Cunningham gets
a whiff of your breath, when you&#8217;ve had it, you&#8217;ll
get yours. Most of the boys have never done anything
worse than apple stealing. It was the
adventure. All keyed up for war and no place to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
go, and this was a kind of safety valve. Already
half of them are beginning to knock in the knees.
Game, understand, but now worried about the
future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A peg or two before turning in won&#8217;t hurt anybody.
I&#8217;m not touching it in the daytime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep away from him when you do&mdash;that&#8217;s all.
We&#8217;re depending on you and Cunningham to pull
through. If you two get to scrapping the whole
business will go blooey. If we play the game
according to contract there&#8217;s a big chance of
getting back to the States without having the
sheriff on the dock to meet us. But if you mess it
up because an unexpected stroke put a woman on
board, you&#8217;ll end up as shark bait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I will and maybe I won&#8217;t,&#8221; was the
truculent rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; said Cleve, a vast discouragement in
his tone. &#8220;You lay a course as true and fine as a
hair, and run afoul a rotting derelict in the night!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flint laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shan&#8217;t make any trouble. I&#8217;ll say my
prayers regular until we make shore finally. The
agreement was to lay off the Cleigh booze. I
brought on board only a couple of quarts, and
they&#8217;ll be gone before we raise the Catwick.
But if I feel like talking to the woman I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your funeral, not mine,&#8221; was the ominous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
comment. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been on the beach once too
often, Flint, to play a game like this straight.
But Cunningham had to have you, because you
know the Malay lingo. Remember, he isn&#8217;t afraid
of anything that walks on two feet or four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither am I&mdash;when I want anything. But
glass beads!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was only a lure for Cleigh, who&#8217;d go
round the world for any curio he was interested
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I mean. If it were diamonds or
pearls or rubies, all well and good. But a string
of glass beads! The old duffer is a nut!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he is. But if you had ten or twelve
millions, what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump for Prome and foot it to the silk bazaar,
where there are three or four of the prettiest Burmese
girls you ever laid your eyes on. Then I&#8217;d
buy the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo and close it
to the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in five years&mdash;the old beach again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Flint scowled at the oily, heaving rolls, brassy
and dazzling. He was bored. For twelve weeks
he had circled the dull round of ship routine, with
never shore leave that was long enough for an
ordinary drinking bout. He was bored stiff.
Suddenly his thin lips broke into a smile. Cleve,
noting the smile, divined something of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
impellent thought behind that smile, and he grew uneasy.
He recalled his own expression of a few moments
gone&mdash;the unreckoned derelict.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming up,&#8221; said Cunningham.
&#8220;It makes me feel that you trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to,&#8221; admitted Jane.</p>
<p>A disturbing phenomenon. Always there was
a quickening of her heart-beats at the beginning of
each encounter with this unusual gentleman rover.
It was no longer fear. What was it? Was it the
face of him, too strong and vital for a woman&#8217;s, too
handsome for a man&#8217;s? Was it his dark, fiery eye
which was always reversing what his glib tongue
said? Some hidden magnetism? Alone, the
thought of him was recurrent, no matter how
resolutely she cast it forth. Even now she could
not honestly say whether she was here to ask
questions of Cunningham or of herself. Perhaps
it was because he was the unknown, whereas
Denny was for the most part as readable as an
open book. The one like the forest stream, sometimes
turbulent but always clear; the other like the
sea through which they plowed, smooth, secret,
ominous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do your guardians know where you are?&#8221;&mdash;raillery
in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I came to ask some questions.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Curiosity. Sit down. What is it you wish to
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All this&mdash;and what will be the end?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, doubtless there will be an end, but I&#8217;m
not seer enough to foretell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have some doubts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only those that beset all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But somehow&mdash;well, you don&#8217;t seem to belong
to this sort of game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly he had set a wall between. She
had no answer, and her embarrassment was
visible on her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here and there across the world rough men
call me Slue-Foot. Perhaps my deformity has
reacted upon my soul and twisted that. Perhaps
if my countenance had been homely and rugged I
would have walked the beaten paths of respectability.
But the two together!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman such as you are would be. You are
a true daughter of the great mother&mdash;Pity. But
I have never asked pity of any. I have asked only
that a man shall keep his word to me as I will keep
mine to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are risking your liberty, perhaps your
life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been risking that for more than twenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
years. The habit has become normal. All my
life I&#8217;ve wanted a real adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gazed at him in utter astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;An adventure? Why, you yourself told me
that you had risked your life a hundred times!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That?&#8221;&mdash;with a smile and a shrug. &#8220;That
was business, the day&#8217;s work. I mean an adventure
in which I am accountable to no man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to God?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, if you want it that way. For
myself, I&#8217;m something of a pagan. I have dreamed
of this day. When you were a little girl didn&#8217;t you
dream of a wonderful doll that could walk and
make almost human noises? Well, I&#8217;m realizing
my doll. I am going pearl hunting in the South
Seas&mdash;the thing I dreamed of when I was a
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why commit piracy? Why didn&#8217;t you
hire a steamer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I must have my joke, too. But I hadn&#8217;t
counted on you. In every campaign there is the
hollow road of Ohain. Napoleon lost Waterloo
because of it. Your presence here has forced me
to use a hand without velvet. These men expected
a little fun&mdash;cards and drink; and some of
them are grumbling with discontent. But don&#8217;t
worry. In five days we&#8217;ll be off on our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the joke?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That will have to wait. For a few minutes
I heard you reading to-day. Your voice is like a
bell at sea in the evening. &#8216;Many waters cannot
quench love,&#8217;&#8221; he quoted, the flash of opals in his
eyes, though his lips were smiling gently. &#8220;The
Bible is a wonderful book. Its authors were
poets who were not spoiled by the curse of rime.
Does it amuse you to hear me talk of the Bible?&mdash;an
unregenerate scalawag? Well, it is like this:
I am something of an authority on illuminated
manuscripts. I&#8217;ve had to wade through hundreds
of them. That is the method by which I became
acquainted with the Scriptures. The Song of
Songs! Lord love you, if that isn&#8217;t pure pagan,
what is? I prefer the Proverbs. Ask Cleigh if
he has that manuscript with him. It&#8217;s in a
remarkable state of preservation. Remember?
&#8216;There be three things which are too wonderful for
me, yea, four which I know not: The way of an
eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock;
the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the
way of a man with a maid.&#8217; Ask Cleigh to show
you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh! The name swung her back to the
original purpose of this visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the Cleighs well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the father. He has the gift of strong
men&mdash;unforgetting and unforgiving. I know little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
or nothing about the son, except that he is a chip
of the old block. Queer twist in events, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any idea what estranged them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know they were at outs until the night
before we sailed. They don&#8217;t speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. And it seems so utterly foolish!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cherchez la femme!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You believe that was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always so, always and eternally the
woman. I don&#8217;t mean that she is always to
blame; I mean that she is always there&mdash;in the
background. But you! I say, now, here&#8217;s the
job for you! Bring them together. That&#8217;s your
style. For weeks now you three will be together.
Within that time you&#8217;ll be able to twist both of
them round your finger. I wonder if you realize
it? You&#8217;re not beautiful, but you are something
better&mdash;splendid. Strong men will always be
gravitating toward you, wanting comfort, peace.
You&#8217;re not the kind that sets men&#8217;s hearts on
fire, that makes absconders, fills the divorce courts,
and all that. You&#8217;re like a cool hand on a hot
forehead. And you have a voice as sweet as a
bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instinct&mdash;the female fear of the trap&mdash;warned
Jane to be off, but curiosity held her to the chair.
She was human; and this flattery, free of any
suggestion of love-making, gave her a warming,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
pleasurable thrill. Still there was a fly in the
amber. Every woman wishes to be credited with
hidden fires, to possess equally the power to damn
men as well as to save them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has there never been&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman? Have I not just said there is always
a woman?&#8221; He was sardonic now. &#8220;Mine,
seeing me walk, laughed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t worth it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she wasn&#8217;t. But when we are twenty the
heart is blind. So Cleigh and the boy don&#8217;t
speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleigh hasn&#8217;t injured you in any way, has he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Injured me? Of course not! I am only
forced by circumstance&mdash;and an oblique sense of
the comic&mdash;to make a convenience of him. And
by the Lord Harry, it&#8217;s up to you to help me out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221;&mdash;bewildered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p>Jane gazed through the doorway at the sea.
There was apparently no horizon, no telling
where the sea ended and the faded blue of the
sky began. There was something about this sea
she did not like. She was North-born. It
seemed to her that there was really less to fear
from the Atlantic fury than from these oily,
ingratiating, rolling mounds. They were the
Uriah Heep of waters. She knew how terrible
they could be, far more terrible than the fiercest
nor&#8217;easter down the Atlantic. Typhoon! How
could a yacht live through a hurricane? She
turned again toward Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are like that,&#8221; she said, irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham rose and peered under the half-drawn
blind.</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be complimentary, but hanged if I
know! Smooth?&mdash;is that what you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That rather cuts. I might be terrible. I
don&#8217;t know&mdash;never met the occasion; but I do
know that I&#8217;m not treacherous. You certainly
are not afraid of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t exactly know. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s too peaceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To last? I see. But it isn&#8217;t as though I
were forcing you to go through with the real
voyage. Only a few days more, and you&#8217;ll have
seen the last of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I meant was,&#8221; she corrected, &#8220;that
nothing might happen, nobody get hurt. Human
beings can plan only so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough. Every programme is subject
to immediate change. But, Lord, what a
lot of programmes go through per schedule! Still,
you are right. It all depends upon chance. We
say a thing is cut and dried, but we can&#8217;t prove it.
But so far as I can see into the future, nothing is
going to happen, nobody is going to walk the
plank. Piracy on a basis of 2.75 per cent.&mdash;the
kick gone out of it! But if you can bring about
the reconciliation of the Cleighs the old boy will
not be so keen for chasing me all over the map
when this job is done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me what those beads are?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I will&mdash;all in due time. What does
Cleigh call them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love beads!&#8221; scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my solemn word, that&#8217;s exactly what they
are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. But remember, you promise to
tell me when the time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That and other surprising things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up as often as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham accompanied her to the bridge
ladder and remained until she was speeding along
the deck; then he returned to his chart. But the
chart was no longer able to hold his attention. So
he levelled his gaze upon the swinging horizon and
kept it there for a time. Odd fancy, picturing the
girl on the bridge in a hurricane, her hair streaming
out behind her, her fine body leaning on the
wind. A shadow in the doorway broke in upon
this musing. Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in and sit down,&#8221; invited Cunningham.</p>
<p>But Cleigh ignored the invitation and stepped
over to the steersman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Miss Norman been in here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long was she here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir; perhaps half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh stalked to the door, but there he turned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and for the first time since Cunningham had taken
the yacht Cleigh looked directly, with grim intentness,
into his enemy&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Battle, murder, and sudden death!&#8221; Cunningham
laughed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to tell me,
Cleigh! I can see it in your eyes. If Miss Norman
wants to come here and ask questions, I&#8217;m the
last man to prevent her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh thumped down the ladder. Cunningham
was right&mdash;there was murder in his heart.
He hurried into the main salon, and there he found
Jane and Dennison conversing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman, despite my warning you went
up to the chart house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had some questions to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forbid you emphatically. I am responsible
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no longer your prisoner, Mr. Cleigh; I
am Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You went up there alone?&#8221; demanded Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? I&#8217;m not afraid. He will not break
his word to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn him!&#8221; roared Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; she cried, seizing him
by the sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;To have it out with him! I can&#8217;t stand this
any longer!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what will become of me&mdash;if anything
happens to you, or anything happens to him?
What about the crew if he isn&#8217;t on hand to hold
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>The muscular tenseness of the arm she held relaxed.
But the look he gave his father was on a
par with that which Cleigh had so recently spent
upon Cunningham. Cleigh could not support it,
and turned his head aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. But mind you keep in sight! If
you will insist upon talking with the scoundrel, at
least permit me to be within call. What do you
want to talk to him for, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither of you will stoop to ask him questions,
so I had to. And I have learned one thing. He is
going pearl hunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Off the Catwick? There&#8217;s no pearl
oyster in that region,&#8221; Dennison declared.
&#8220;Either he is lying or the Catwick is a blind. The
only chance he&#8217;d have would be somewhere in the
Sulu Archipelago; and this time of year the pearl
fleets will be as thick as flies in molasses. Of
course if he is aware of some deserted atoll, why,
there might be something in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever hunted pearls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a second-hand sort of way. But if pearls
are his game, why commit piracy when he could
have chartered a tramp to carry his crew? There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
more than one old bucket hereabouts ready to his
hand for coal and stores. He&#8217;ll need a shoe spoon
to get inside or by the Sulu fleets, since the oyster
has been pretty well neglected these five years, and
every official pearler will be hiking down there.
But it requires a certain amount of capital and a
stack of officially stamped paper, and I don&#8217;t
fancy Cunningham has either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh smiled dryly, but offered no comment.
He knew all about Cunningham&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he say anything about being picked up by
another boat?&#8221; asked Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Jane. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe it
will be hard for me to make him tell me that. I
believe that he will keep his word, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane, he has broken the law of the sea. I don&#8217;t
know what the penalty is these days, but it used to
be hanging to the yard-arm. He won&#8217;t be particular
about his word if by breaking it he can save
his skin. He&#8217;s been blarneying you. You&#8217;ve let
his plausible tongue and handsome face befog
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not true!&#8221; she flared. Afterward she
wondered what caused the flash of perversity.
&#8220;And I resent your inference!&#8221; she added with
uplifted chin.</p>
<p>Dennison whirled her about savagely, stared
into her eyes, then walked to the companion, up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
which he disappeared. This rudeness astonished
her profoundly. She appealed silently to the father.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are riding a volcano,&#8221; said Cleigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not sure but he&#8217;s setting some trap for you. He
may need you as a witness for the defense. Of
course I can&#8217;t control your actions, but it would
relieve me immensely if you&#8217;d give him a wide
berth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not the one who brought me aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. And the more I look at it, the more I am
convinced that you came on board of your own
volition. You had two or three good opportunities
to call for assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You believe that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve as much right to believe that as you have
that Cunningham will keep his word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, but it was an outburst of anger.
And it had a peculiar twist, too. She was furious
because both father and son were partly correct;
and yet there was no diminution of that trust she
was putting in Cunningham. &#8220;Next you&#8217;ll be
hinting that I&#8217;m in collusion with him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Only he is an extraordinarily fascinating
rogue, and you are wearing the tinted goggles of
romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fearing that she might utter something regrettable,
she flew down the port passage and
entered her cabin, where she remained until dinner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
She spent the intervening hours endeavouring to
analyze the cause of her temper, but the cause was
as elusive as quicksilver. Why should she trust
Cunningham? What was the basis of this trust?
He had, as Denny said, broken the law of the sea.
Was there a bit of black sheep in her, and was the
man calling to it? And this perversity of hers
might create an estrangement between her and
Denny; she must not let that happen. The
singular beauty of the man&#8217;s face, his amazing
career, and his pathetic deformity&mdash;was that it?</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the captain?&#8221; asked Cunningham,
curiously, as he noted the vacant chair at the table
that night.</p>
<p>&#8220;On deck, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he dining to-night?&#8221;&mdash;an accent of
suspicion creeping into his voice. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t
contemplating making a fool of himself, is he?
He&#8217;ll get hurt if he approaches the wireless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Togo,&#8221; broke in Cleigh, &#8220;bring the avocats
and the pineapple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham turned upon him with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleigh, when I spin this yarn some day I&#8217;ll
carry you through it as the man who never batted
an eye. I can see now how you must have bluffed
Wall Street out of its boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Cunningham saw that Jane was distrait
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
he made no attempt to pull her out of it. He ate
his dinner, commenting only occasionally. Still,
he bade her a cheery good-night as he returned to
the chart house, where he stayed continually,
never quite certain what old Captain Newton
might do to the wheel and the compass if left
alone too long.</p>
<p>Dennison came in immediately after Cunningham&#8217;s
departure and contritely apologized to Jane
for his rudeness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m on the rack; nerves all raw; tearing
me to pieces to sit down and twiddle my
thumbs. Will you forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will! I understand. You are all
anxious about me. Theoretically, this yacht is a
volcano, and you&#8217;re trying to keep me from kicking
off the lid. But I&#8217;ve an idea that the lid will stay
on tightly if we make believe we are Mr. Cunningham&#8217;s
guests. But it is almost impossible to suspect
that anything is wrong. Whenever a member
of the crew comes in sight he is properly polite,
just as he would be on a liner. If I do go to the
bridge again I&#8217;ll give you warning. Good-night,
Mr. Cleigh, I&#8217;ll read to you in the morning. Good-night&mdash;Denny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh, sighing contentedly, dipped his fingers
into the finger bowl and brushed his lips.</p>
<p>The son drank a cup of coffee hastily, lit his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
pipe, and went on deck. He proceeded directly
to the chart house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham, I&#8217;ll swallow my pride and ask a
favour of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;&mdash;in a neutral tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cook tells me that all the wine and liquor
are in the dry-stores compartment. Will you open
it and let me chuck the stuff overboard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Cunningham, promptly. &#8220;When
I turn this yacht back to your father not a single
guy rope will be out of order. It would be a fine
piece of work to throw all those rare vintages over
the rail simply to appease an unsubstantial fear on
your part! No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the men should break in? And it would
be easy, because it is nearer them than us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank your father for building the deck like a
city flat. But if the boys should break in, there&#8217;s
the answer,&#8221; said Cunningham, laying his regulation
revolver on the chart table. &#8220;And every
mother&#8217;s son of them knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You refuse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. But if anything happens I&#8217;ll be on
top of you, and all the bullets in that clip won&#8217;t
stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, you bore me. Your father and the
girl are good sports. You ought to be one. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
given you the freedom of the yacht for the girl&#8217;s
sake when caution bids me dump you into the
brig. I begin to suspect that your misfortunes are
due to a violent temper. Run along with your
thunder; I don&#8217;t want you hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I come through this alive&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll join your dad peeling off my hide&mdash;if
you can catch me!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was with the greatest effort that Dennison
crushed down the desire to leap upon his tormentor.
He stood tense for a moment, then stepped
out upon the bridge. His fury was suffocating
him, and he realized that he was utterly helpless.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the crew in their quarters
were astonished to see the old man&#8217;s son enter.
None of them stirred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, any you chaps got an extra suit of twill?
This uniform is getting too thick for this latitude.
I&#8217;m fair melting down to the bone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; bellowed a young giant, swinging out
of his bunk. He rummaged round for a space and
brought forth a light-weight khaki shirt and a pair
of ducks. &#8220;Guess these&#8217;ll fit you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. Navy stores?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison&#8217;s glance travelled from face to face,
and he had to admit that there was none of the
criminal type here. They might carry through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
decently. Nevertheless, hereafter he would sleep on
the lounge in the main salon. If any tried to force
the dry-stores door he would be likely to hear it.</p>
<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock the following morning there
occurred an episode which considerably dampened
Jane&#8217;s romantical point of view regarding this
remarkable voyage. Cleigh had gone below for
some illuminated manuscripts and Dennison was
out of sight for the moment. She leaned over the
rail and watched the flying fish. Suddenly out
of nowhere came the odour of whisky.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to take a trip up to the cutwater
at night and see the flying fish in the phosphorescence.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not stir. Instinctively she knew who
the owner of this voice would be&mdash;the man Cunningham
called Flint. A minute&mdash;an unbearable
minute&mdash;passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Too haughty to be a good fellow, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Footsteps, a rush of wind, a scuffling, and an
oath brought her head about. She saw Flint go
balancing and stumbling backward, finally to
sprawl on his hands and knees, and following him,
in an unmistakable attitude, was Dennison. Jane
was beginning to understand these Cleighs; their
rage was terrible because it was always cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny!&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>But Dennison continued on toward Flint.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p>Flint was a powerful man, or had been.
The surprise of the attack over, he jumped
to his feet, and blazing with murderous
fury rushed Dennison. Jane saw a tangle of
arms, and out of this tangle came a picture that
would always remain vivid&mdash;Flint practically
dangling at the end of Dennison&#8217;s right arm. The
rogue tore and heaved and kicked and struck, but
futilely, because his reach was shorter. Dennison
let go unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, you filthy beachcomber! If
you ever dare speak to Miss Norman again or
come within ten feet of her I&#8217;ll kill you with bare
hands! There are no guns on board this yacht&mdash;bare
hands. Now go back to your master and say
that I&#8217;d like to do the same to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flint, his hands touching his throat with inquiring
solicitude&mdash;Flint eyed Dennison with that
mixture of pain and astonishment that marks the
face of a man who has been grossly deceived.
Slowly he revolved on his shaking legs and staggered
forward, shortly to disappear round the deck
house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Denny, you&#8217;ve done a foolish thing!
You&#8217;ve shamed that man before me and put murder
in his heart. It isn&#8217;t as if we were running
the yacht. We are prisoners of that man and his
fellows. It would have been enough for you to
have stepped in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any parlour varnish left, Jane. His
shoulder was almost touching yours. It was an
intentional insult, and that was enough for me. The
dog! Still looking at the business romantically?&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was bitter. Her reproach, no doubt
justified, cut deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m beginning to become a little afraid&mdash;afraid
that the men may get out of hand. I don&#8217;t
care what you and your father think, but I believe
Cunningham honestly wishes us to reach the
Catwick without any conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Cunningham!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again&mdash;angry and bitter! Why
can&#8217;t you take it sensibly, like your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father doesn&#8217;t happen to be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped with mystifying abruptness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t happen to be what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sort of fool I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not so good a comrade as you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you understand? I&#8217;ve been stood upon
my head. The worry about you on one side and
the contact with my father on the other would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
sufficient. But Cunningham and this pirate crew
as a tail to the kite! But, thank God, I had the wit
to come in search of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank God every minute, Denny! You are
very strong,&#8221; she added, shyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad of that, too. But I repeat, I&#8217;ve lost the
parlour varnish and the art of parlour talk. For
seven years I&#8217;ve been wandering in strange places,
most of them hard; so I say what I think and act
on the spur. That dog had liquor on his breath.
Is Cunningham secretly letting them into the dry-stores?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man may have brought it aboard at
Shanghai. What a horrible thing a great war
is! In a week it knocks aside all the bars of
restraint it took years to erect. Could a venture
like this have happened in 1913? I doubt it.
There comes your father. But who is the man
with him? He&#8217;s been hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s watchdog. They had to beat him up
to get his gun away from him. That was the
racket we heard. Evidently Father expects you to
read to him, so I&#8217;ll take a constitutional.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where&#8217;s your uniform?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laid it aside. From now on it will be stuffy.
Those military boots were killing me. I borrowed
the rig from one of the pirates, but I&#8217;ll have to go
barefoot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come to your chair soon? I shall
worry otherwise. You might run into that man
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t go below,&#8221; he promised, starting off.</p>
<p>Twenty thousand at compound interest for
seven years, he thought, as he made the first turn.
A tidy sum to start life with. Could he swallow
his pride? And yet what hope was there of making
a real living? He had never specialized in
anything, and the world was calling for specialists
and discarding the others. Another point to consider:
Foot-loose for seven years, could he stand
the shackles of office work, routine, the sameness
day in and day out? He was returning to the
States without the least idea what he wanted to
do; that was the disturbing phase of it. If only he
were keen for something! A typical son of the rich
man. The only point in his favour was that he
had not spent his allowances up and down Broadway.
No, he would never touch a dollar of that
money. That was final.</p>
<p>What lay back of this sudden desire to make
good in the world? Love! There wasn&#8217;t the
slightest use in lying to himself. He wanted Jane
Norman with all the blood in his body, with all the
marrow in his bones; and he had nothing to offer
her but empty hands.</p>
<p>He shot a glance toward the bridge. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
because he had no right to speak&mdash;obligated to silence
by two reasons&mdash;that easy-speaking scoundrel
might trap her fancy. It could not be denied
that he was handsome, but he was nevertheless a
rogue. The two reasons why he must not speak
were potent. In the first place, he had nothing
to offer; in the second place, the terror she was no
doubt hiding bravely would serve only to confuse
her&mdash;that is, she might confuse a natural desire for
protection with something deeper and tenderer,
and then discover her mistake when it was too late.</p>
<p>What was she going to ask of his father when the
time came for reparation? That puzzled him.</p>
<p>He made the rounds steadily for an hour, and
during this time Jane frequently looked over the
top of the manuscript she was reading aloud. At
length she laid the manuscript upon her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cleigh, what is it that makes art treasures
so priceless?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally the depth of the buyer&#8217;s purse.
That is what they say of me in the great auction
rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t buy them just because you are
rich enough to outbid somebody else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am actually fond of all the treasures I
possess. Aside from this, it is the most fascinating
game there is. The original! A painting that
Holbein laid his own brushes on, mixed his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
paint for! I have then something of the man,
tangible, visible; something of his beautiful dreams,
his poverty, his success. There before me is the
authentic labour of his hand, which was guided by
the genius of his brain&mdash;before machinery spoiled
mankind. Oh, yes, machinery has made me rich!
It has given the proletariat the privilege of wearing
yellow diamonds and riding about in flivvers.
That must be admitted. But to have lived in
those days when ambition thought only in beauty!
To have been the boon companions of men like
Da Vinci, Cellini, Michelangelo! Then there are
the adventures of this concrete dream of the artist.
I can trace it back to the bare studio in which it
was conceived, follow its journeys, its abiding
places, down to the hour it comes to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane stared at him astonishedly. All that had
been crampedly hidden in his soul flowed into his
face, warming and mellowing it, even beautifying
it. Cleigh went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where will it go when I have done my little
span? What new adventures lie in store for it?
Across the Ponte Vecchio in Florence runs a
gallery of portraits: at the south end of this
gallery there is or was a corner given over to a
copyist. He strikes you dumb with the cleverness
of his work, but he has only an eye and a hand&mdash;he
hasn&#8217;t a soul. A copy is to the original what a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
dummy is to a live man, no matter how amazingly
well done the copy is. The original, the dream;
nothing else satisfies the true collector.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;that you had so
much romance in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Romance?&#8221; It was almost a bark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly. No human being could love
beauty the way you do and not be romantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Romantic!&#8221; Cleigh leaned back in his chair.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a new point of view for Tungsten Cleigh.
That&#8217;s what my enemies call me&mdash;the hardest
metal on earth. Romantic!&#8221; He chuckled. &#8220;To
hear a woman call me romantic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does not follow that to be romantic one must
be sentimental. Romance is something heroic,
imaginative, big; it isn&#8217;t a young man and a girl
spooning on a park bench. I myself am romantic,
but nobody could possibly call me sentimental.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if I knew that we&#8217;d come through this
without anybody getting hurt I&#8217;d be gloriously
happy. All my life I&#8217;ve been cooped up. For a
little while to be free! But I don&#8217;t like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She indicated Dodge, who sat in Dennison&#8217;s
chair, his head bandaged, his arm in a sling,
thousands of miles from his native plains, at odds
with his environment. His lean brown jaws were
set and the pupils of his blue eyes were mere pin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
points. During the discussion of art, during the
reading, he had not stirred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; said Cleigh, gravely, &#8220;that Dodge
may be only the beginning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Your&mdash;Captain Dennison had an encounter
with the man Flint before you came
up. He is very strong and&mdash;and a bit intolerant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Cleigh rubbed his jaw and smiled
ruminatively. &#8220;He was always rather handy
with his fists. Did he kill the ruffian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, held him at arm&#8217;s length and threatened
to kill him. I&#8217;m afraid Flint will not accept the
situation with good grace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flint? I never liked that rogue&#8217;s face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has found liquor somewhere, and I saw
murder in his eyes. Denny isn&#8217;t afraid, and that&#8217;s
why I am&mdash;afraid he&#8217;ll run amuck uselessly. His
very strength will react against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like that thirty years ago.&#8221; So she
called him Denny? Cleigh laid his hand over
hers. &#8220;Keep your chin up. There&#8217;s a revolver
handy should we need it. I dare not carry it for
fear Cunningham might discover and confiscate
it. Six bullets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if worse comes to worse, will&mdash;will you
save one for me? Please don&#8217;t let Denny do it!
You are old, and if you lived after it wouldn&#8217;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
in your thoughts so long as it would be in his&mdash;if
he killed me. Will you promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;if worse comes to worse. Will you forgive
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. But still I&#8217;m going to hold you to your
word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay the score, whatever it is. Now suppose
you come below with me and take a look at
the paintings? You haven&#8217;t seen my cabin yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was this unusual young woman going to
ask of him? He wondered. The more he thought
over it the more convinced he was that she had
assisted in the abduction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p>After they had gone below Dennison
dropped into Jane&#8217;s chair. Immediately
Dodge began to talk: &#8220;So you nearly
throttled that ornery coyote, huh? Whata you
know about this round-up? The three o&#8217; &#8217;em
came in, and I never smelt nothin&#8217; until they were
on top o&#8217; me. How should I smell anythin&#8217;?
Hobnobbing together for days, how was I to know
they were a bunch of pirates? Is your old man
sore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean appertainin&#8217; to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he could be. Who took care
of you&mdash;bound you up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That nice-lookin&#8217; greaser with the slue foot.
Soft speakin&#8217; like a woman and an eye like a
timber wolf. Some <i>hombre</i>! Where we bound
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows!&#8221;&mdash;dejectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad as that, huh? Your girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No place for a girl. If they hadn&#8217;t busted my
arm I wouldn&#8217;t care so much! If it comes to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
show-down I won&#8217;t be no good to anybody.
Gimme my guns and we&#8217;d be headin&#8217; home in five
minutes. These <i>hombres</i> know somethin&#8217; o&#8217; my
gun play. Gee, it&#8217;s lonesome here!&#8221; Dodge
mused for a moment. &#8220;Say, what&#8217;s your old
man&#8217;s idea hog-tyin&#8217; you that-a-way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll tell you perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. Say, what did the Lord make all
that stuff for?&#8221; with a gesture toward the brazen
sea. &#8220;What&#8217;s it good for, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But for the sea we wouldn&#8217;t have any oysters
or codfish,&#8221; said Dennison, soberly.</p>
<p>Dodge chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oysters and codfish! Say, you&#8217;re all right!
Never knew the old man had a son until you blew
in. Back in New York nobody ever said nothin&#8217;
about you. Where you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of places.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any ridin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you shoot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill any o&#8217; them Bolsheviks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be guesswork. Did you ever kill a
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Didn&#8217;t have to. I&#8217;m pretty good on
the draw, and where I come from they knew it and
didn&#8217;t bother me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shootin&#8217; these days is all in the movies. I was
ridin&#8217; for a film company when your old man
lassoed me for this job. Never know when you&#8217;re
well off&mdash;huh? I thought there wouldn&#8217;t be
nothin&#8217; to do but grub pile three times a day and
the old man&#8217;s cheroots in between. And here I be
now, ridin&#8217; along with a bunch of pirates! Whata
you know about that? And some of them nice boys,
too. If they were riff-raff, barroom bums, I could
get a line on it. But I&#8217;ll have to pass the buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got an extra gun anywhere, have
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d be headin&#8217; east if I had&#8221;&mdash;grimly. &#8220;I&#8217;d
have pared down the odds this mornin&#8217;. That
<i>hombre</i> with the hop-a-long didn&#8217;t leave me a quill
toothpick. Was you thinkin&#8217; of startin&#8217; somethin&#8217;?&#8221;&mdash;hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;d feel more comfortable if Miss Norman
could carry a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. Say, she&#8217;s all right. No hysterics.
Ain&#8217;t many of &#8217;em that wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been snivellin&#8217;
all day and night in her bunk. Been listenin&#8217; to
her readin&#8217;. Gee, you&#8217;d think we were floatin&#8217;
round this codfish lake just for the fun of it! She
won&#8217;t run to cover if a bust-up comes. None
whatever! And I bet she can cook, too. Them
kind can always cook.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Conversation lapsed.</p>
<p>Below, Jane was passing through an unusual
experience.</p>
<p>Said Cleigh at the start: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to show
you the paintings&mdash;there are fourteen in all. I
will tell you the history of each. And above all,
please bear in mind the price of each picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she thought the request an odd one, coming
from the man as she knew him.</p>
<p>Most of the treasures were in his own spacious
cabin. There was a Napoleonic corner&mdash;a Meissonier
on one side and a Detaille on the other. In
a stationary cabinet there were a pair of stirrups, a
riding crop, a book on artillery tactics, a pair of
slippers beaded with seed pearls, and a buckle
studded with sapphires.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are those?&#8221; she asked, attracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;They belonged to the Emperor and his first
Empress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Napoleon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Corsican. Next to the masters, I&#8217;ve a
passion for things genuinely Napoleonic. The
hussar is by Meissonier and the skirmish by
Detaille.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much is this corner worth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say, except that I would not part with
those objects for a hundred thousand; and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
are friends of mine who would pay half that sum
for them&mdash;behind my back. This is a Da Vinci.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour passed. Jane honestly tried to be
thrilled by the splendour of the names she heard,
but her eye was always travelling back toward the
slippers and the buckle. The Empress Josephine!
Romance and gallantry in the old, old days!</p>
<p>&#8220;The painting in your cabin is by Holbein. It
cost me sixteen thousand. Now let us go out and
look at the rug. That is the apple of my eye. It
is the second finest example of the animal rug in
the world. A sheet of pure gold, half an inch
thick, covering the rug from end to end, would not
equal its worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane admired the rug, but she would have preferred
the gold. Her sense of the beautiful was
alive, but there was always in her mind the genteel
poverty of the past. She was beginning to understand.
To go in quest of the beautiful required
an unlimited purse and an endless leisure; and she
would have never the one nor the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much gold would that be?&#8221; she inquired,
naïvely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly eighty thousand. Have you kept in
mind the sums I have given you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Let me see&mdash;good heavens, a quarter of
a million! But why do you carry them about like
this?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m something of a rogue myself. I
could not enjoy the rug and the paintings except
on board. The French, the Italian, and the
Spanish governments could confiscate every solitary
painting except the Meissonier and the Detaille,
for the simple reason that they were stolen.
Oh, I did not steal them myself; I merely purchased
them with one eye shut. If I hadn&#8217;t
bought them they would have gone to some other
collector. Do you get a glimmer of the truth
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth?&#8221;&mdash;perplexedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;where Cunningham will get his pearls?&#8221;&mdash;bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I could not touch him. A quarter of a
million! And with his knowledge of the secret
marts he could easily dispose of them. Worth a
bold stroke, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how will he get them off the yacht&mdash;transship
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her faith in Cunningham began to waver. A
quarter of a million! The thought was as bells in
her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the outside issues I have no inkling. But I
have shown you his pearls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the crew! Certainly they will not return
to any port with us. And why should he lie to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
me? There is no reason in the world why he
shouldn&#8217;t have told me, if he had committed
piracy to obtain your paintings. And he was
poring over maps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some tramp is probably going to pick him up.
He&#8217;s ordered us away from the wireless. Cunningham
must have his joke, so he is beguiling you
with twaddle about hunting pearls. He is robbing
me of my treasures, and I can&#8217;t strike back on
that count. But I can land him in prison on the
count of piracy; and by the Lord Harry, I&#8217;ll do it
if it takes my last dollar! He&#8217;ll rue this adventure,
or they call me Tungsten for nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted so to believe in him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not difficult to understand why. He has a
silver tongue and a face like John the Baptist&mdash;del
Sarto&#8217;s&mdash;and you are romantic. The picture
of him has enlisted your sympathies. You are
filled with pity that he should be so richly endowed,
facially and mentally, and to be a cripple
such as children laugh over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you never considered what mental
anguish must be the portion of a man whose body
is twisted as his is? I know. So I pity him profoundly,
even if he is a rogue. That&#8217;s all I was
born for&mdash;to pity and to bind up. And I pity you,
Mr. Cleigh, you who have walled your heart in
granite.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re plain-spoken, young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, certain sick minds need plain speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then my mind is sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And only a little while gone it was romantic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred million hands begging for bread,
and you crossing the world for a string of glass
beads whose value is only sentimental!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let that pass, Miss Norman. I have
trusted lieutenants who attend to my charities.
I&#8217;m not a miser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are, with the greatest thing in the world&mdash;human
love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall a man give it where it is not wanted?
But enough of this talk. I have shown you Cunningham&#8217;s
pearls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Night and wheeling stars. It was stuffy in the
crew&#8217;s quarters. Half naked, the men lolled
about, some in their bunks, some on the floor.
The orders were that none should sleep on deck
during the voyage to the Catwick.</p>
<p>&#8220;All because the old man brings a skirt on board,
we have to sweat blood in the forepeak!&#8221; growled
Flint. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a right to a little sport.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure we have!&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker was sitting on the edge of his bunk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
He was a fine specimen of young manhood, with a
pleasant, rollicking Irish countenance. He looked
as if he had been brought up clean and had carried
his cleanliness into the world. The blue anchor
and love birds on his formidable forearms proclaimed
him a deep-sea man. It was he who had
given Dennison the shirt and the ducks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, we have a right to a little sport! But
why call in the undertaker to help us out? You
poor fish, all the way from San Francisco you&#8217;ve
been grousing because shore leaves weren&#8217;t long
enough for you to get prime soused in. What&#8217;s
two months in our young lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been free to do as I liked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it! I&#8217;ll say so! The chief laid down
the rules of this game, and we all took oath to
follow those rules. The trouble with you is, you&#8217;ve
been reading dime novels. Where do you think
you are&mdash;raiding the Spanish Main? There&#8217;s
every chance of our coming out top hole, as those
lime-juicers say, with oodles of dough and a whole
skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, don&#8217;t I know this Sulu game? I tell you,
if he does find his atoll there won&#8217;t be any shell.
Not a chance in a hundred! Somebody&#8217;s been
giving him a song and dance. As I get the dope,
some pearl-hunting friend of his croaks and leaves
him this chart. Old stuff! I bet a million boobs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
have croaked trying to locate the red cross on a
chart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the devil did you sign on, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted a little fun, and I&#8217;m going to have it.
There&#8217;s champagne and Napoleon brandy in the
dry-stores. Wouldn&#8217;t hurt us to have a little of it.
If we&#8217;ve got to go to jail we might as well go lit up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flint, you talk too much,&#8221; said a voice from
the doorway. It was Cunningham&#8217;s. He leaned
carelessly against the jamb. The crew fell silent
and motionless. &#8220;Boys, you&#8217;ve heard Hennessy.
Play it my way and you&#8217;ll wear diamonds; mess it
up and you&#8217;ll all wear hemp. The world will forgive
us when it finds out we&#8217;ve only made it
laugh.&#8221; Cunningham strolled over to Flint, who
rose to his feet. &#8220;Flint, I want that crimp-house
whisky you&#8217;ve been swigging on the sly. No back
talk! Hand it over!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#8221; said Flint, his jaw jutting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p>Cunningham did not answer immediately.
From Flint his glance went roving
from man to man, as if trying to read
what they expected of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flint, you were recommended to me for your
knowledge of the Sulu lingo. We&#8217;ll need a crew
of divers, and we&#8217;ll have to pick them up secretly.
That&#8217;s your job. It&#8217;s your only job outside doing
your watch with the shovel below. Somehow
you&#8217;ve got the wrong idea. You think this is a
junket of the oil-lamp period. All wrong! You
don&#8217;t know me, and that&#8217;s a pity; because if you
did know something about me you&#8217;d walk carefully.
When we&#8217;re off this yacht, I don&#8217;t say. If
you want what old-timers used to call their pannikin
of rum, you&#8217;ll be welcome to it. But on board
the <i>Wanderer</i>, nothing doing. Get your duffel out.
I&#8217;ll have a look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it yourself,&#8221; said Flint.</p>
<p>Cunningham appeared small and boyish beside
the ex-beachcomber.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m speaking to you decently, Flint, when I
ought to bash in your head.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>The tone was gentle and level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The expectant men thereupon witnessed a feat
that was not only deadly in its precision but oddly
grotesque. Cunningham&#8217;s right hand flew out
with the sinister quickness of a cobra&#8217;s strike, and
he had Flint&#8217;s brawny wrist in grip. He danced
about, twisted and lurched until he came to an
abrupt stop behind Flint&#8217;s back. Flint&#8217;s mouth
began to bend at the corners&mdash;a grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll break it yourself, Flint, if you move
another inch,&#8221; said Cunningham, nonchalantly.
&#8220;This is the gentlest trick I have in the bag. Cut
out the booze until we&#8217;re off this yacht. Be a
good sport and play the game according to contract.
I don&#8217;t like these side shows. But you
wanted me to show you. Want to call it off?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweat began to bead Flint&#8217;s forehead. He was
straining every muscle in his body to minimize
that inexorable turning of his elbow and shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stuff is in Number Two bunker,&#8221; he said,
with a ghastly grin. &#8220;I&#8217;ll chuck it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now!&#8221; Cunningham stepped back.
&#8220;I might have made it your neck. But I&#8217;m
patient, because I want this part of the game to
go through according to schedule. When I turn
back this yacht I want nothing missing but the
meals I&#8217;ve had.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>Flint rubbed his arm, scowling, and walked over
to his bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Cunningham, &#8220;so far you&#8217;ve been
bricks. Shortly we&#8217;ll be heading southeast on our
own. Wherever I am known, men will tell you
that I never break my word. I promised you
that we&#8217;d come through with clean heels. Something
has happened which we could not forestall.
There is a woman on board. It is not necessary
to say that she is under my protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clumped out into the passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say!&#8221; burst out the young sailor named
Hennessy. &#8220;I&#8217;m a tough guy, but I couldn&#8217;t
have turned that trick. Hey, you! If you&#8217;ve
got any hooch in the coal bunkers, heave it over.
I&#8217;m telling you! These soft-spoken guys are the
kind I lay off, believe you me! I&#8217;ve seen all kinds,
and I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they kick you out of the Navy?&#8221; snarled
Flint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, are you asking me to do it?&#8221; flared the
Irishman. &#8220;You poor boob, you&#8217;d be in the sick
bay if there hadn&#8217;t been a lady on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said a lady! Stand up, you scut!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Flint rolled into his bunk and turned his
face to the partition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>Cunningham leaned against the port rail.
These bursts of fury always left him depressed.
He was not a fighting man at all and fate was
always flinging him into physical contests. He
might have killed the fool: he had been in a killing
mood. He was tired. Somehow the punch was
gone from the affair, the thrill. Why should that
be?</p>
<p>For years he had been planning something like
this, and then to have it taste like stale wine!
Vaguely he knew that he had made a discovery.
The girl! If he were poring over his chart, his
glance would drift away; if he were reading, the
printed page had a peculiar way of vanishing. Of
course it was all nonsense. But that night in
Shanghai something had drawn him irresistibly to
young Cleigh&#8217;s table. It might have been the
colour of her hair. At any rate, he hadn&#8217;t noticed
the beads until he had spoken to young Cleigh.</p>
<p>Glass beads! Queer twist. A little trinket,
worthless except for sentimental reasons, throwing
these lives together. Of course an oil would have
lured the elder Cleigh across the Pacific quite as
successfully. The old chap had been particularly
keen for a sea voyage after having been cooped up
for four years. But in the event of baiting the
trap with a painting neither the girl nor the son
would have been on board. And Flint could have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
had his noggin without anybody disturbing him,
even if the contract read otherwise.</p>
<p>Law-abiding pirates! How the world would
chuckle if the yarn ever reached the newspapers!
He had Cleigh in the hollow of his hand. In fancy
he saw Cleigh placing his grievance with the
British Admiralty. He could imagine the conversation,
too.</p>
<p>&#8220;They returned the yacht in perfect condition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they steal anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham could positively see Cleigh&#8217;s jowls
redden as he shook his head to the query.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry. You can&#8217;t expect us to waste coal
hunting for a scoundrel who only borrowed your
yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what was the row between Cleigh and his
son? That was a puzzler. Not a word! They
ignored each other absolutely. These dinners
were queer games, to be sure. All three men
spoke to the girl, but neither of the Cleighs
spoke to him or to each other. A string of glass
beads!</p>
<p>What about himself? What had caused his
exuberance to die away, his enthusiasm to grow
dim? Why, a month gone he would burst into
such gales of laughter that his eyes would fill with
tears at the thought of this hour! And the wine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
tasted flat. The greatest sea joke of the age, and
he couldn&#8217;t boil up over it any more!</p>
<p>Love? He had burnt himself out long ago.
But had it been love? Rather had it not been a
series of false dawns? To a weepy-waily woman
he would have offered the same courtesies, but
she would not have drawn his thoughts in any
manner. And this one kept entering his thoughts
at all times. That would be a joke, wouldn&#8217;t it?
At this day to feel the scorch of genuine passion!</p>
<p>To dig a pit for Cleigh and to stumble into
another himself! In setting this petard he hadn&#8217;t
got out of range quickly enough. His sense of
humour was so keen that he laughed aloud, with a
gesture which invited the gods to join him.</p>
<p>Jane, who had been watching the solitary
figure from the corner of the deck house and
wondering who it was, recognized the voice. The
cabin had been stuffy, her own mental confusion
had driven sleep away, so she had stolen on deck
for the purpose of viewing the splendours of the
Oriental night. The stars that seemed so near, so
soft; the sea that tossed their reflections hither
and yon, or spun a star magically into a silver
thread and immediately rolled it up again; the
brilliant electric blue of the phosphorescence and
the flash of flying fish or a porpoise that ought to
have been home and in bed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>She hesitated. She was puzzled. She was not
afraid of him&mdash;the puzzle lay somewhere else.
She was a little afraid of herself. She was afraid
of anything that could not immediately be translated
into ordinary terms of expression. The man
frankly wakened her pity. He seemed as lonely
as the sea itself. Slue-Foot! And somewhere a
woman had laughed at him. Perhaps that had
changed everything, made him what he was.</p>
<p>She wondered if she would ever be able to return
to the shell out of which the ironic humour
of chance had thrust her. Wondered if she could
pick up again philosophically the threads of dull
routine. Jane Norman, gliding over this mysterious
southern sea, a lone woman among strong and
reckless men! Piracy! Pearls! Rugs and paintings
worth a quarter of a million! Romance!</p>
<p>Did she want it to last? Did she want romance
all the rest of her days? What was this thing
within her that was striving for expression? For
what was she hunting? What worried her and
put fear into her heart was the knowledge that
she did not know what she wanted. From all
directions came questions she could not answer.</p>
<p>Was she in love? If so, where was the fire that
should attend? Was it Denny&mdash;or yonder riddle?
She felt contented with Denny, but Cunningham&#8217;s
presence seemed to tear into unexplored corners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
of her heart and brain. If she were in love with
Denny, why didn&#8217;t she thrill when he approached?
There was only a sense of security, contentment.</p>
<p>The idea of racing round the world romantically
with Denny struck her as absurd. Equally contrary
to reason was the picture of herself and
Cunningham sitting before a wood fire. What
was the matter with Jane Norman?</p>
<p>There was one bar of light piercing the fog.
She knew now why she had permitted Cleigh to
abduct her. To bring about a reconciliation between
father and son. And apparently there was
as much chance as of east meeting west. She
walked over to the rail and joined Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cabin was stuffy. I couldn&#8217;t sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there isn&#8217;t a wild streak in you that corresponds
with mine. You fall into the picture
naturally&mdash;curious and unafraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I be afraid, and why shouldn&#8217;t
I be curious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The greatest honour a woman ever paid me.
I mean that you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of me when
everything should warn you to give me plenty of
sea room.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know more about men than I do about
women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I know too much about both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been other women&mdash;besides the one
who laughed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Perhaps I was cruel enough to make
them pay for that.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wonder what would have happened if it
had been a woman like you instead of the one who
laughed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have laughed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This damned face of mine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t say that! Why not try to make
over your soul to match it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that done?&#8221;</p>
<p>The irony was so gentle that she fell silent for a
space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to take Mr. Cleigh&#8217;s paintings
when you leave us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young lady, all I have left to be
proud of is my word. I give it to you that I am
going after pearls. It may sound crazy, but I
can&#8217;t help that. I am realizing a dream. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
something of a fatalist&mdash;I&#8217;ve had to be. I&#8217;ve always
reasoned that if I could make the dream
come true&mdash;this dream of pearls&mdash;I&#8217;d have a
chance to turn over a new leaf. I&#8217;ve had to commit
acts at times that were against my nature,
my instincts. I&#8217;ve had to be cruel and terrible,
because men would not believe a pretty man could
be a strong one. Do you understand? I have
been forced to cruel deeds because men would not
credit a man&#8217;s heart behind a woman&#8217;s face. I
possess tremendous nervous energy. That&#8217;s the
principal curse. I can&#8217;t sit still; I can&#8217;t remain
long anywhere; I must go, go, go! Like the
Wandering Jew, Ishmael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what Ishmael means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;God heareth.&#8217; Have you ever asked Him
for anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why should I, since He gave me this
withered leg? Please don&#8217;t preach to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, then. But I&#8217;m terribly sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are. But&mdash;don&#8217;t become too
sorry. I might want to carry you off to my atoll.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you took me away with you by force, I&#8217;d
hate you and you&#8217;d hate yourself. But you won&#8217;t
do anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you believe so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why, but I do believe it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To be trusted by a woman, a good woman!
I&#8217;ll tell that to the stars. Tell me about yourself&mdash;what
you did and how you lived before you came
this side.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a long story, and he nodded from
time to time understandingly. Genteel poverty,
a life of scrimp and pare&mdash;the cage. Romance&mdash;a
flash of it&mdash;and she would return to the old life
quite satisfied. Peace, a stormy interlude; then
peace again indefinitely. It came to him that he
wanted the respect of this young woman for always.
But the malice that was ever bubbling up to his
tongue and finding speech awoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I find my pearls&mdash;and then come back
for you? Romance and adventure! These warm
stars always above us at night; the brilliant days;
the voyages from isle to isle; palms and gay
parrakeets, cocoanuts and mangosteens&mdash;and let
the world go hang!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply, but she moved a little away.
He waited for a minute, then laughed softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear young lady, this is the interlude
you&#8217;ve always been longing for. Fate has popped
you out of the normal for a few days, and presently
she&#8217;ll pop you back into it. Some day you&#8217;ll
marry and have children; you&#8217;ll sink into the rut of
monotony again and not be conscious of it. On
winter nights, before the fire, when the children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
have been put to bed, your man buried behind his
evening paper, you will recall Slue-Foot and the
interlude and be happy over it. You&#8217;ll hug and
cuddle it to your heart secretly. A poignant craving
in your life had been satisfied. Kidnapped by
pirates, under Oriental stars! Fifteen men on a
dead man&#8217;s chest&mdash;yo-ho, and a bottle of rum!
A glorious adventure, with three meals the day
and grand opera on the phonograph. Shades of
Gilbert and Sullivan! And you will always be
wondering whether the pirate made love to you
in jest or in earnest&mdash;and he&#8217;ll always be wondering,
too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham turned away abruptly and clumped
toward the bridge ladder, which he mounted.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason her heart became
filled with wild resentment against him. Mocking
her, when she had only offered him kindness!
She clung to the idea of mockery because it was the
only tangible thing she could pluck from her confusion.
Thus when she began the descent of the
companionway and ran into Dennison coming up
her mood was not receptive to reproaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watching the stars and the phosphorescence.
I could not sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Mr. Cunningham was with me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I warned you to keep away from that scoundrel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you use that tone to me? Have you
any right to tell me what I shall and shall not do?&#8221;
she stormed at him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to talk to someone.
You go about in one perpetual gloom. I purpose
to see and talk to Cunningham as often as I please.
At least he amuses me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this she rushed past him and on to her
cabin, the door of which she closed with such
emphasis that it was heard all over the yacht&mdash;so
sharp was the report that both Cleigh and Dodge
awoke and sat up, half convinced that they had
heard a pistol shot!</p>
<p>Jane sat down on her bed, still furious. After
a while she was able to understand something of
this fury. The world was upside down, wrong
end to. Dennison, not Cunningham, should have
acted the debonair, the nonchalant. Before this
adventure began he had been witty, amusing,
companionable; now he was as interesting as a
bump on a log. At table he was only a poor
counterfeit of his father, whose silence was maintained
admirably, at all times impressively dignified.
Whereas at each encounter Dennison played
directly into Cunningham&#8217;s hands, and the latter
was too much the banterer not to make the most
of these episodes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>What if he was worried? Hadn&#8217;t she more
cause to worry than any one else? For all that,
she did not purpose to hide behind the barricaded
door of her cabin. If there was a tragedy in the
offing it would not fall less heavily because one
approached it with melancholy countenance.</p>
<p>Heaven knew that she was no infant as regarded
men! In the six years of hospital work
she had come into contact with all sorts and
conditions of men. Cunningham might be the
greatest scoundrel unhung, but so far as she was
concerned she need have no fear. This knowledge
was instinctive.</p>
<p>But when her cheek touched the pillow she began
to cry softly. She was so terribly lonely!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p>The space through which Jane had passed
held Dennison&#8217;s gaze for two or three minutes.
Then he sat down on the companionway
step, his arms across his knees and his forehead
upon his arms. What to say? What to
do? She expected him to be amusing!&mdash;when
he knew that the calm on board was of the same
deceptive quality as that of the sea&mdash;below, the
terror!</p>
<p>It did not matter that the crew was of high
average. They would not be playing such a game
unless they were a reckless lot. At any moment
they might take it into their heads to swarm over
Cunningham and obliterate him. Then what?
If the episode of the morning had not convinced
Jane, what would? The man Flint had dropped
his mask; the others were content to wear theirs
yet awhile. Torture for her sake, the fear of
what might actually be in store for her, and she
expected him to talk and act like a chap out of a
novel!</p>
<p>Ordinarily so full of common sense, what had
happened to her that her vision should become so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
obscured as not to recognize the danger of the
man? Had he been ugly, Jane would probably
have ignored him. But that face of his, as handsome
as a Greek god&#8217;s, and that tongue with its
roots in oil! And there was his deformity&mdash;that
had drawn her pity. Playing with her, and she
deliberately walked into the trap because he was
amusing! Why shouldn&#8217;t he be, knowing that he
held their lives in the hollow of his hand? What
imp of Satan wouldn&#8217;t have been amiable?</p>
<p>Because the rogues did not run up the skull and
crossbones; because they did not swagger up and
down the deck, knives and pistols in their sashes,
she couldn&#8217;t be made to believe them criminals!</p>
<p>Amusing! She could not see that if he spoke
roughly it was only an expression of the smothered
pain of his mental crucifixion. He could not tell
her he loved her for fear she might misinterpret
her own sentiments. Besides, her present mood
was not inductive to any declaration on his part;
a confession might serve only to widen the breach.
Who could say that it wasn&#8217;t Cunningham&#8217;s game
to take Jane along with him in the end? There
was nothing to prevent that. His father holding
aloof, the loyal members of the crew in a most certain
negligible minority, what was there to prevent
Cunningham from carrying off Jane?</p>
<p>Blood surged into Dennison&#8217;s throat; a murderous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
fury boiled up in him; but he remembered in
time what these volcanic outbursts had cost him in
the past. So he did not rush to the chart house.
Cunningham would lash him with ridicule or be
forced to shoot him. But his rage carried him as
far as the wireless room. He could hear the smack
of the spark, but that was all. He tried the door&mdash;locked.
He tried the shutters&mdash;latched. Cunningham&#8217;s
man was either calling or answering
somebody. Ten minutes inside that room and
there would be another tale to tell.</p>
<p>In the end Dennison spent his fury by travelling
round the deck until the sea and sky became like
pearly smoke. Then he dropped into a chair and
fell asleep.</p>
<p>Cunningham had also watched through the
night. The silent steersman heard him frequently
rustling papers on the chart table or clumping
to the bridge or lolling on the port sills&mdash;a restlessness
that had about it something of the captive
tiger.</p>
<p>Retrospection&mdash;he could not break the crowding
spell of it, twist mentally as he would; and the
counter-thought was dimly suicidal. The sea
there; a few strides would carry him to the end of
the bridge, and then&mdash;oblivion. And the girl
would not permit him to enact this thought. He
laughed. God had mocked him at his birth, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
the devil had played with him ever since. He had
often faced death hotly and hopefully, but to consider
suicide coldly!</p>
<p>A woman who had crossed his path reluctantly,
without will of her own; the sort he had always
ignored because they had been born for the peace
of chimney corners! She&mdash;the thought of her&mdash;could
bring the past crowding upon him and
create in his mind a suicidal bent!</p>
<p>Pearls! A great distaste of life fell upon him;
the adventure grew flat. The zest that had been
his ten days gone, where was it?</p>
<p>Imagination! He had been cursed with too
much of it. In his youth he had skulked through
alleys and back streets&mdash;the fear of laughter and
ridicule dogging his mixed heels. Never before
to have paused to philosophize over what had
caused his wasted life! Too much imagination!
Mental strabismus! He had let his over-sensitive
imagination wreck and ruin him. A woman&#8217;s
laughter had given him the viewpoint of a careless
world; and he had fled, and he had gone on fleeing
all these years from pillar to post. From a shadow!</p>
<p>He was something of a monster. He saw now
where the fault lay. He had never stayed long
enough in any one place for people to get accustomed
to him. His damnable imagination! And
there was conceit of a sort. Probably nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
paid any attention to him after the initial shock
and curiosity had died away. There was Scarron
in his wheel chair&mdash;merry and cheerful and brave,
jesting with misfortune; and men and women had
loved him.</p>
<p>A moral coward, and until this hour he had
never sensed the truth! That was it! He had
been a moral coward; he had tried to run away
from fate; and here he was at last, in the blind
alley the coward always found at the end of the
run. He had never thought of anything but
what he was&mdash;never of what he might have been.
For having thrust him unfinished upon a thoughtless
rather than a heartless world he had been
trying to punish fate, and had punished only himself.
A wastrel, a roisterer by night, a spendthrift,
and a thief!</p>
<p>What had she said?&mdash;reknead his soul so that
it would fit his face? Too late!</p>
<p>One staff to lean on, one only&mdash;he never broke
his word. Why had he laid down for himself this
law? What had inspired him to hold always to
that? Was there a bit of gold somewhere in his
grotesque make-up? A straw on the water, and
he clutched it! Why? Cunningham laughed
again, and the steersman turned his head slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Williams, do you believe in God?&#8221; asked
Cunningham.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, when I&#8217;m holding down the wheel&mdash;perhaps.
The screw is always edging a ship off,
and the lighter the ballast the wider the yaw. So
you have to keep hitching her over a point to starboard.
You trust to me to keep that point, and I
trust to God that the north stays where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet legally you&#8217;re a pirate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that? Well, a fellow ain&#8217;t much of a
pirate that plays the game we play. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! And yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, some of the boys are getting restless.
And I&#8217;ll be mighty glad when we raise that old
Dutch bucket of yours. They ain&#8217;t bad, understand;
just young and heady and wanting a little
fun. They growl a lot because they can&#8217;t sleep
on deck. They growl because there&#8217;s nothing
to drink. Of course it might hurt Cleigh&#8217;s feelings,
but I&#8217;d like to see all his grog go by the board.
You see, sir, it ain&#8217;t as if we&#8217;d just dropped down
from Shanghai. It&#8217;s been tarnation dull ever
since we left San Francisco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once on the other boat, they can make a night
of it if they want to. But I&#8217;ve given my word on
the <i>Wanderer</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s final.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham returned to his chart. All these
cogitations because a woman had entered his life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
uninvited! Ten days ago he had not been aware
of her existence; and from now on she would be
always recurring in his thoughts.</p>
<p>She was not conscious of it, but she was as a
wild thing that had been born in captivity, and
she was tasting the freedom of space again without
knowing what the matter was. But it is the law
that all wild things born in captivity lose everything
but the echo; a little freedom, a flash of
what might have been, and they are ready to return
to the cage. So it would be with her.</p>
<p>Supposing&mdash;no, he would let her return to her
cage. He wondered&mdash;had he made his word a
law simply to meet and conquer a situation such
as this? Or was his hesitance due to the fear of
her hate? That would be immediate and unabating.
She was not the sort that would bend&mdash;she
would break. No, he wasn&#8217;t monster enough
to play that sort of game. She should take back
her little adventure to her cage, and in her old age
it would become a pleasant souvenir.</p>
<p>He rose and leaned on his arms against a port
sill and stared at the stars until they began to fade,
until the sea and the sky became like the pearls he
would soon be seeking. A string of glass beads,
bringing about all these events!</p>
<p>At dawn he went down to the deck for a bit of
exercise before he turned in. When he beheld
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Dennison sound asleep in the chair, his mouth
slightly open, his bare feet standing out conspicuously
on the foot rest, a bantering, mocking
smile twisted the corners of Cunningham&#8217;s lips.
Noiselessly he settled himself in the adjacent chair,
and cynically hoping that Dennison would be
first to wake he fell asleep.</p>
<p>The <i>Wanderer&#8217;s</i> deck toilet was begun and consummated
between six and six-thirty, except in
rainy weather. Hose, mops, and holystone, until
the teak looked as if it had just left the Rangoon
sawmills; then the brass, every knob and piping,
every latch and hinge and port loop. The care
given the yacht since leaving the Yang-tse might
be well called ingratiating. Never was a crew
more eager to enact each duty to the utmost&mdash;with
mighty good reason.</p>
<p>But when they came upon Dennison and Cunningham,
asleep side by side, they drew round the
spot, dumfounded. But their befuddlement was
only a tithe of that which struck Cleigh an hour
later. It was his habit to take a short constitutional
before breakfast; and when he beheld the
two, asleep in adjoining chairs, the fact suggesting
that they had come to some friendly understanding,
he stopped in his tracks, as they say, never
more astonished in all his days.</p>
<p>For as long as five minutes he remained motionless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
the fine, rugged face of his son on one side
and the amazing beauty of Cunningham&#8217;s on the
other. But in the morning light, in repose,
Cunningham&#8217;s face was tinged with age and sadness.
There was, however, no grain of pity
in Cleigh&#8217;s heart. Cunningham had made his
bed of horsehair; let him twist and writhe upon
it.</p>
<p>But the two of them together, sleeping as peacefully
as babes! Dennison had one arm flung behind
his head. It gave Cleigh a shock, for he
recognized the posture. As a lad Dennison had
slept that way. Cunningham&#8217;s withered leg was
folded under his sound one.</p>
<p>What had happened? Cleigh shook his head;
he could not make it out. Moreover, he could
not wake either and demand the solution to the
puzzle. He could not put his hand on his son&#8217;s
shoulder, and he would not put it on Cunningham&#8217;s.
Pride on one side and distaste on the
other. But the two of them together!</p>
<p>He got round the impasse by kicking out the
foot rest of the third chair. Immediately Cunningham
opened his eyes. First he turned to see
if Dennison was still in his chair. Finding this to
be the case, he grinned amiably at the father.
Exactly the situation he would have prayed for
had he believed in the efficacy of prayer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Surprises you, eh? Looks as if he had signed
on with the Great Adventure Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice woke Dennison, who blinked in the
sunshine for a moment, then looked about. He
comprehended at once.</p>
<p>With easy dignity he swung his bare feet to the
deck and made for the companion; never a second
glance at either his father or Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chip of the old block!&#8221; observed Cunningham.
&#8220;You two! On my word, I never saw two bigger
fools in all my time! What&#8217;s it about? What
the devil did he do&mdash;murder someone, rob the
office safe, or marry Tottie Lightfoot? And Lord,
how you both love me! And how much more
you&#8217;ll love me when I become the dear departed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh, understanding that the situation was a
creation of pure malice on Cunningham&#8217;s part&mdash;Cleigh
wheeled and resumed his tramp round the
deck.</p>
<p>Cunningham plowed his fingers through his
hair, gripped and pulled it in a kind of ecstasy.
Cleigh&#8217;s phiz. The memory of it would keep him
in good humour all day. After all, there was a lot
of good sport in the world. The days were all
right. It was only in the quiet vigils of the night
that the uninvited thought intruded. On board
the old Dutch tramp he would sleep o&#8217;nights, and
the past would present only a dull edge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>If the atoll had cocoanut palms, hang it, he
would build a shack and make it his winter home!
<i>Dolce far niente!</i> Maybe he might take up the
brush again and do a little amateur painting.
Yes, in the daytime the old top wasn&#8217;t so bad.
He hoped he would have no more nonsense from
Flint. A surly beggar, but a necessary pawn in
the game.</p>
<p>Pearls! Some to sell and some to play with.
Lovely, tenderly beautiful pearls&mdash;a rope of them
round Jane Norman&#8217;s throat. He slid off the
chair. As a fool, he hung in the same gallery as
the Cleighs.</p>
<p>Cleigh ate his breakfast alone. Upon inquiry
he learned that Jane was indisposed and that
Dennison had gone into the pantry and picked up
his breakfast there. Cleigh found the day unspeakably
dull. He read, played the phonograph,
and tried all the solitaires he knew; but a hundred
times he sensed the want of the pleasant voice of
the girl in his ears.</p>
<p>What would she be demanding of him as a
reparation? He was always sifting this query
about, now on this side, now on that, without getting
anywhere. Not money. What then?</p>
<p>That night both Jane and Dennison came in to
dinner. Cleigh saw instantly that something was
amiss. The boy&#8217;s face was gloomy and his lips
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
locked, and the girl&#8217;s mouth was set and cheerless.
Cleigh was fired by curiosity to ascertain the
trouble, but here again was an impasse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I spoke so roughly last night,&#8221; said
Dennison, unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am sorry that I answered you so sharply.
But all this worry and fuss over me is getting on
my nerves. You&#8217;ve written down Cunningham as
a despicable rogue, when he is only an interesting
one. If only you would give banter for banter, you
might take some of the wind out of his sails. But
instead you go about as if the next hour was to be
our last!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go! In a minute we&#8217;ll be digging up
the hatchet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she softened the reproach by smiling. At
this moment Cunningham came in briskly and
cheerfully. He sat down, threw the napkin across
his knees, and sent an ingratiating smile round the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleigh&#8221;&mdash;he was always talking to Cleigh, and
apparently not minding in the least that he was
totally ignored&mdash;&#8220;Cleigh, they are doing a good
job in the Santa Maria delle Grazie, so I am told.
Milan, of course. They are restoring Da Vinci&#8217;s
Cenacolo. What called it to mind is the fact that
this is also the last supper. To-morrow at this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
hour you will be in possession and I&#8217;ll be off for my
pearls.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recipients of this remarkable news appeared
petrified for a space. Cunningham enjoyed the
astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds almost too good to be true, doesn&#8217;t it?
Still, it&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s tiptop news, Cunningham,&#8221; said Dennison.
&#8220;I hope when you go down the ladder you
break your infernal neck. But the luck is on your
side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope that it stays there,&#8221; replied Cunningham,
unruffled. He turned to Cleigh again:
&#8220;I say, we&#8217;ve always been bewailing that job of
Da Vinci&#8217;s. But the old boy was a seer. He
knew that some day there would be American
millionaires and that I&#8217;d become a force in art.
So he put his subject on a plaster wall so I couldn&#8217;t
lug it off. A canvas the same size, I don&#8217;t say;
but the side of a church!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A ship is going to pick you up to-morrow?&#8221;
asked Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The crew of the <i>Wanderer</i> goes to the
<i>Haarlem</i> and the <i>Haarlem</i> crew transships to the
<i>Wanderer</i>. You see, Cleigh, I&#8217;m one of those
efficiency sharks. In this game I have left nothing
to chance. Nothing except an act of God&mdash;as
they say on the back of your steamer ticket&mdash;can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
derange my plans. Not the least bit of inconvenience
to you beyond going out of your
course for a few days. The new crew was signed
on in Singapore&mdash;able seamen wanting to return to
the States. Hired them in your name. Clever
idea of me, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Cleigh, speaking directly to
Cunningham for the first time since the act of
piracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this will give you enough coal to turn and
make Manila, where you can rob the bunkers of
one of your freighters. Now, then, early last
winter in New York a company was formed, the
most original company in all this rocky old world&mdash;the
Great Adventure Company, of which I am
president and general adviser. Pearls! Each
member of the crew is a shareholder, undersigned
at fifteen hundred shares, par value one dollar.
These shares are redeemable October first in New
York City if the company fails, or are convertible
into pearls of equal value if we succeed. No
widows and orphans need apply. Fair enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair enough, indeed,&#8221; admitted Cleigh.</p>
<p>Dennison stared at his father. He did not
quite understand this willingness to hold converse
with the rogue after all this rigorously maintained
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the Great Adventure Company had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
to be financed,&#8221; went on Cunningham with a
deprecating gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; assented Cleigh. &#8220;And that, I
suppose, will be my job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indirectly. You see, Eisenfeldt told me he
had a client ready to pay eighty thousand for the
rug, and that put the whole idea into my noodle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Well, you will find the crates and frames
and casings in the forward hold,&#8221; said Cleigh in a
tone which conveyed nothing of his thoughts.
&#8220;It would be a pity to spoil the rug and the oils
for the want of a little careful packing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham rose and bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleigh, you are a thoroughbred!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have your hide, Cunningham, if it takes all
I have and all I am!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p>Cunningham sat down. &#8220;The spirit
is willing, Cleigh, but the flesh is weak.
You&#8217;ll never get my hide. How will
you go about it? Stop a moment and mull it over.
How are you going to prove that I&#8217;ve borrowed
the rug and the paintings? These are your
choicest possessions. You have many at home
worth more, but these things you love. Out of
spite, will you inform the British, the French, the
Italian governments that you had these objects
and that I relieved you of them? In that event
you&#8217;ll have my hide, but you&#8217;ll never set eyes upon
the oils again except upon their lawful walls&mdash;the
rug, never! On the other hand, there is every
chance in the world of my returning them to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your word?&#8221; interrupted Jane, ironically.</p>
<p>So Cleigh was right? A quarter of a million in
art treasures!</p>
<p>&#8220;My word! I never before realized,&#8221; continued
Cunningham, &#8220;what a fine thing it is to possess
something to stand on firmly&mdash;a moral plank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison&#8217;s laughter was sardonic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Moral plank is good,&#8221; was his comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Norman,&#8221; said Cunningham, maliciously,
&#8220;I slept beside the captain this morning, and he
snores outrageously.&#8221; The rogue tilted his chin
and the opal fire leaped into his eyes. &#8220;Do you
want me to tell you all about the Great Adventure
Company, or do you want me to shut up and
merely proceed with the company&#8217;s business without
further ado? Why the devil should I care
what you think of me? Still, I do care. I want
you to get my point of view&mdash;a rollicking adventure,
in which nobody loses anything and I have
a great desire fulfilled. Hang it, it&#8217;s a colossal
joke, and in the end the laugh will be on nobody!
Even Eisenfeldt will laugh,&#8221; he added, enigmatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you intend to take the oils and the rug
and later return them?&#8221; demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely! That&#8217;s the whole story. Only
Cleigh here will not believe it until the rug and
oils are dumped on the door-step of his New York
home. I needed money. Nobody would offer to
finance a chart with a red cross on it. So I had to
work it out in my own fashion. The moment
Eisenfeldt sees these oils and the rug he becomes
my financier, but he&#8217;ll never put his claw on them
except for one thing&mdash;that act of God they mention
on the back of your ticket. Some raider may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
have poked into this lagoon of mine. In that case
Eisenfeldt wins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty case, Cunningham, but it won&#8217;t hold
water. It is inevitable that Eisenfeldt gets the
rug and the paintings, and you are made comfortable
for the rest of your days. A shabby business,
and you shall rue it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in it any longer,&#8221; returned
Cleigh.</p>
<p>Cunningham appealed to Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the whole story, then I&#8217;ll tell you
what I believe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You may be telling
the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a queer idea&mdash;wanting his word believed!
Why should it matter to him whether they believed
in the honour of his word or not, when he
held the whip hand and could act as he pleased?
The poor thing! And as that phrase was uttered
in thought, the glamour of him was dissipated;
she saw Cunningham as he was, a poor benighted
thing, half boy, half demon, a thing desperately
running away from his hurt and lashing out at
friends and enemies alike on the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell your story&mdash;all of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham began:</p>
<p>&#8220;About a year ago the best friend I had&mdash;perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
the only friend I had&mdash;died. He left me his
chart and papers. The atoll is known, but uncharted,
because it is far outside the routes. I
have no actual proofs that there will be shell in
the lagoon; I have only my friend&#8217;s word&mdash;the
word of a man as honest as sunshine. Where this
shell lies there is never any law. Some pearl
thiever may have fallen upon the shell since my
friend discovered it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; said Cleigh, &#8220;I lose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, yes! All financial ventures are attended
by certain risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money? Why didn&#8217;t you come to me for
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! To you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham&#8217;s astonishment was perfect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There was a time when I would have
staked a good deal on your word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham rested his elbows on the table and
clutched his hair&mdash;a despairing gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use! I can&#8217;t get it to you! I can&#8217;t make
you people understand! It isn&#8217;t the pearls, it&#8217;s
the game; it&#8217;s all the things that go toward the
pearls. I want to put over a game no man ever
played before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane began to find herself again drawn toward
him, but no longer with the feeling of unsettled
mystery. She knew now why he drew her. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
was the male of the species to which she belonged&mdash;the
out-trailer, the hater of humdrum, of
dull orbits and of routine. The thrilling years he
had spent&mdash;business! This was the adventure of
which he had always dreamed, and since it would
never arrive as a sequence, he had proceeded to
dramatize it! He was Tom Sawyer grown up;
and for a raft on the Mississippi substitute a seagoing
yacht. There was then in this matter-of-fact
world such a man, and he sat across the table
from her!</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing I had come to you and you had advanced
the money?&#8221; said Cunningham, earnestly.
&#8220;All cut and dried, not a thrill, not a laugh, nothing
but the pearls! I have never had a boyhood
dream realized but, hang it, I&#8217;m going to realize
this one!&#8221; He struck the table violently. &#8220;Set
the British after me, and you&#8217;ll never see this stuff
again. You&#8217;ll learn whether my word is worth
anything or not. Lay off for eight months, and if
your treasures are not yours again within that
time you won&#8217;t have to chase me. I&#8217;ll come to
you and have the tooth pulled without gas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison&#8217;s eyes softened a little. Neither had
he realized any of his boyhood dreams. For all
that, the fellow was as mad as a hatter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m a colossal ass, and half the fun
is knowing that I am.&#8221; The banter returned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
Cunningham&#8217;s tongue. &#8220;But this thing will go
through&mdash;I feel it. I will have had my fun, and
you will have loaned your treasures to me for
eight months, and Eisenfeldt will have his principal
back without interest. The treasures go
directly to a bank vault. There will be two receipts,
one dated September&mdash;mine; and one dated
November&mdash;Eisenfeldt&#8217;s. I hate Eisenfeldt. He&#8217;s
tricky; his word isn&#8217;t worth a puff of smoke; he&#8217;s
ready at all times to play both ends from the
middle. I want to pay him out for crossing my
path in several affairs. He&#8217;s betting that I will
find no pearls. So to-morrow I will exhibit the
rug and the Da Vinci to convince him, and he will
advance the cash. Can&#8217;t you see the sport of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would make very good reading,&#8221; said
Cleigh, scraping the shell of his avocado pear.
&#8220;I can get you on piracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prove it! You can say I stole the yacht, but
you can&#8217;t prove it. The crew is yours; you hired
it. The yacht returns to you to-morrow without
a scratch on her paint. And the new crew will
know absolutely nothing, being as innocent as
newborn babes. Cleigh, you&#8217;re no fool. What
earthly chance have you got? You love that rug.
You&#8217;re not going to risk losing it positively, merely
to satisfy a thirst for vengeance. You&#8217;re human.
You&#8217;ll rave and storm about for a few days, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
you&#8217;ll accept the game as it lies. Think of all the
excitement you&#8217;ll have when a telegram arrives
or the phone rings! I told you it was a whale of a
joke; and in late October you&#8217;ll chuckle. I know
you, Cleigh. Down under all that tungsten there
is the place of laughter. It will be better to laugh
by yourself than to have the world laugh at you.
Hoist by his own petard! There isn&#8217;t a newspaper
syndicate on earth that wouldn&#8217;t give me a
fortune for just the yarn. Now, I don&#8217;t want the
world to laugh at you, Cleigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerate of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I know what that sort of laughter is.
Could you pick up the old life, the clubs? Could
a strong man like you exist in an atmosphere of
suppressed chuckles? Mull it over. If these
treasures were honourably yours I&#8217;d never have
thought of touching them. But you haven&#8217;t any
more right to them than I have, or Eisenfeldt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison leaned back in his chair. He began
to laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham, my apologies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
thought you were a scoundrel, and you are only a
fool&mdash;the same brand as I! I&#8217;ve been aching to
wring your neck, but that would have been a pity.
For eight months life will be full of interest for
me&mdash;like waiting for the end of a story in the
magazines.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But there is one thing missing out of the tale,&#8221;
Jane interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221; asked Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those beads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, those beads! They belonged to an empress
of France, and the French Government is
offering sixty thousand for their return. Napoleonic.
And now will you answer a question of
mine? Where have you hidden them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane did not answer, but rose and left the dining
salon. Silence fell upon the men until she returned.
In her hand she held Ling Foo&#8217;s brass
hand warmer. She set it on the table and pried
back the jigsawed lid. From the heap of punk and
charcoal ashes she rescued the beads and laid them
on the cloth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very clever. They are yours,&#8221; said Cunningham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Findings is keepings. They are
as much yours as mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane pushed the string toward Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is sixty thousand dollars in gold in my
safe. When we land in San Francisco I will turn
over the money to you. You have every right in
the world to it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>Cleigh blew the ash from the glass beads and
circled them in his palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they are yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s it to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have decided to reserve my decision,&#8221;
answered Cleigh, dryly. &#8220;To hang you &#8217;twixt
wind and water will add to the thrill, for evidently
that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s on your own you&#8217;ll only be wasting coal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh toyed with the beads.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Haarlem</i>. Maybe I can save you a lot
of trouble,&#8221; said Cunningham. &#8220;The name is
only on her freeboard and stern, not on her
master&#8217;s ticket. The moment we are hull down
the old name goes back.&#8221; Cunningham turned to
Jane. &#8220;Do you believe I&#8217;ve put my cards on the
table?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that if I humanly can I&#8217;ll keep my word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worth many pearls of price!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing,&#8221; said Cleigh, trickling the beads
from palm to palm&mdash;&#8220;supposing I offered you the
equivalent in cash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Eisenfeldt has my word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You refuse?&#8221; Plainly Cleigh was jarred out of
his calm. &#8220;You refuse?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already explained,&#8221; said Cunningham,
wearily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told you that I like sharp knives
to play with. If you handle them carelessly
you&#8217;re cut. How about you?&#8221; Cunningham
addressed the question to Dennison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m neutral and interested. I&#8217;ve always
had a sneaking admiration for a tomfool. They
were Shakespeare&#8217;s best characters. Consider me
neutral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh rose abruptly and stalked from the salon.</p>
<p>Cunningham lurched and twisted to the forward
passage and disappeared.</p>
<p>When next Jane saw him in the light he was
bloody and terrible.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p>Jane and Dennison were alone. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;are we two awake, or are we having
the same nightmare?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way he hugs his word! Imagine a man
stepping boldly and mockingly outside the pale,
and carrying along his word unsullied with him!
He&#8217;s mad, Denny, absolutely mad! The poor
thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>That phrase seemed to liberate something in his
mind. The brooding oppression lifted its siege.
His heart was no longer a torture chamber.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to be his partner, Jane. I&#8217;m as big a
fool as he is. Who but a fool would plan and
execute a game such as this? But he&#8217;s sound on
one point. It&#8217;s a colossal joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham will have to dig a pretty deep
hole somewhere if he expects to hide successfully.
It&#8217;s a hundred-to-one shot that father will never
see his rug again. He probably realizes that, and
he will be relentless. He&#8217;ll coal at Manila and
turn back. He&#8217;ll double or triple the new crew&#8217;s
wages. Money will mean nothing if he starts after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
Cunningham. Of course I&#8217;ll be out of the picture
at Manila.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why your father kidnaped me so
easily? I thought maybe I could find a chink in
his armour and bring you two together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve found the job hopeless!&#8221; Dennison
shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what the cause was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him. He&#8217;ll tell it better than I can. So
you hid the beads in that hand-warmer! Not half
bad. But why don&#8217;t you take the sixty thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an old-fashioned conscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean Father&#8217;s gold, but the French
Government&#8217;s. Comfort as long as you lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I could not touch even that money. The
beads were stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, Lord! Then there are three of us&mdash;Cunningham,
myself, and you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you calling me a tomfool?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly. What&#8217;s the feminine?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed and rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are almost human to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a little talk with your
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck. I&#8217;m going to have a fresh pot of
coffee. I shall want to keep awake to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just an idea. You&#8217;d better turn in when
the interview is over. Good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane stood framed in the doorway for a moment.
Under the reading lamp in the main salon she saw
Cleigh. He was running the beads from hand to
hand and staring into space. Behind her she
heard Dennison&#8217;s spoon clatter in the cup as he
stirred the coffee.</p>
<p>Wild horses! She felt as though she were being
pulled two ways by wild horses! For she was
about to demand of Anthony Cleigh the promised
reparation. And which of two things should she
demand? All this time, since Cleigh had uttered
the promise, she had had but one thought&mdash;to
bring father and son together, to do away with
this foolish estrangement. For there did not
seem to be on earth any crime that merited such
a condition. If he humanly could&mdash;he had modified
the promise with that. What was more human
than to forgive&mdash;a father to forgive a son?</p>
<p>And now Cunningham had to wedge in compellingly!
She could hesitate between Denny and
Cunningham! The rank disloyalty of it shocked
her. To give Cunningham his eight months!
Pity, urgent pity for the broken body and tortured
soul of the man&mdash;mothering pity! Denny was
whole and sound, mentally and physically; he
would never know any real mental torture, anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
that compared with Cunningham&#8217;s, which
was enduring, now waxing, now waning, but
always sensible. To secure for him his eight
months, without let or hindrance from the full
enmity of Cleigh; to give him his boyhood dream,
whether he found his pearls or not. Her throat
became stuffed with the presage of tears. The
poor thing!</p>
<p>But Denny, parting from his father at Manila,
the cleavage wider than ever, beyond hope! Oh,
she could not tolerate the thought of that! These
two, so full of strong and bitter pride&mdash;they
would never meet again if they separated now.
Perhaps fate had assigned the rôle of peacemaker
to her, and she had this weapon in her hand to enforce
it or bring it about&mdash;the father&#8217;s solemn
promise to grant whatever she might ask. And
she could dodder between Denny and Cunningham!</p>
<p>To demand both conditions would probably
appeal to Cleigh as not humanly possible. One
or the other, but not the two together.</p>
<p>An interval of several minutes of which she had
no clear recollection, and then she was conscious
that she was reclining in her chair on deck, staring
at the stars which appeared jerkily and queerly
shaped&mdash;through tears. She hadn&#8217;t had the
courage to make a decision. As if it became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
any easier to solve by putting it over until to-morrow!</p>
<p>Chance&mdash;the Blind Madonna of the Pagan&mdash;was
preparing to solve the riddle for her&mdash;with a
thunderbolt!</p>
<p>The mental struggle had exhausted Jane somewhat,
and she fell into a doze. When she woke
she was startled to see by her wrist watch that it
was after eleven. The yacht was plowing along
through the velvet blackness of the night. The
inclination to sleep gone, Jane decided to walk the
deck until she was as bodily tired as she was
mentally. All the hidden terror was gone. To-morrow
these absurd pirates would be on their
way.</p>
<p>Study the situation as she might, she could discover
no flaw in this whimsical madman&#8217;s plans.
He held the crew in his palm, even as he held
Cleigh&mdash;by covetousness. Cleigh would never
dare send the British after Cunningham; and the
crew would obey him to the letter because that
meant safety and recompense. The Great Adventure
Company! Only by an act of God!
And what could possibly happen between now
and the arrival of the <i>Haarlem</i>?</p>
<p>Cleigh had evidently turned in, for through the
transoms she saw that the salon lights were out.
She circled the deck house six times, then went up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
to the bow and stared down the cutwater at the
phosphorescence. Blue fire! The eternal marvel
of the sea!</p>
<p>A hand fell upon her shoulder. She thought it
would be Denny&#8217;s. It was Flint&#8217;s!</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a good sport, an&#8217; give us a kiss!&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew back, but he caught her arm. His
breath was foul with tobacco and whisky.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll take it!&#8221;</p>
<p>With her free hand she struck him in the face.
It was a sound blow, for Jane was no weakling.
That should have warned Flint that a struggle
would not be worth while. But where&#8217;s the
drunken man with caution? The blow stung
Flint equally in flesh and spirit. He would kiss
this woman if it was the last thing he ever did!</p>
<p>Jane fought him savagely, never thinking to call
to the bridge. Twice she escaped, but each time
the fool managed to grasp either her waist or her
skirt. Then out of nowhere came the voice of
Cunningham:</p>
<p>&#8220;Flint!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dishevelled and breathless, Jane found herself
free. She stumbled to the rail and rested there for
a moment. Dimly she could see the two men enacting
a weird shadow dance. Then it came to
her that Cunningham would not be strong enough
to vanquish Flint, so she ran aft to rouse Denny.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>As she went down the companionway, her knees
threatening to give way, she heard voices, blows,
crashings against the partitions. Instinct told her
to seek her cabin and barricade the door; curiosity
drove her through the two darkened salons to the
forward passage. Only a single lamp was on, but
that was enough. Anthony Cleigh&#8217;s iron-gray head
towering above a whirlwind of fists and forearms!</p>
<p>What had happened? This couldn&#8217;t be real!
She was still in her chair on deck, and what she saw
was nightmare! Out of the calm, all in a moment,
this! Where was Denny, if this picture wasn&#8217;t
nightmare? Cunningham above, struggling with
the whisky-maddened Flint&mdash;Cleigh fighting in
the passage! Dear God, what had happened?</p>
<p>Where was Denny? The question let loose in
her heart and mind all that was emotional, at the
same time enchaining her to the spot where she
stood. Denny! Why, she loved Denny! And
she had not known it consciously until this moment.
Because some presciential instinct warned
her that Denny was either dead or badly hurt!</p>
<p>The narrowness of the passage gave Cleigh one
advantage&mdash;none of the men could get behind
him. Sometimes he surged forward a little,
sometimes he stepped back, but never back of the
line he had set for himself. By and by Jane forced
her gaze to the deck to see what it was that held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
him like a rock. What she saw was only the actual
of what she had already envisaged&mdash;Denny, either
dead or badly hurt!</p>
<p>What had happened was this: Six of the crew,
those spirits who had succumbed to the secret
domination of the man Flint&mdash;the drinkers&mdash;had
decided to celebrate the last night on the <i>Wanderer</i>.
Their argument was that old man Cleigh wouldn&#8217;t
miss a few bottles, and that it would be a long
time between drinks when they returned to the
States; and never might they again have so easy
a chance to taste the juice of the champagne grape.
Where was the harm? Hadn&#8217;t they behaved like
little Fauntleroys for weeks? They did not want
any trouble&mdash;just half a dozen bottles, and back
to the forepeak to empty them. That wouldn&#8217;t
kill the old man. They wouldn&#8217;t even have to
force the door of the dry-stores; they had already
learned that they could tickle the lock out of commission
by the use of a bent wire. Young, restless,
and mischievous&mdash;none of them bad. A bit of
laughter and a few bars of song&mdash;that was all they
wanted. No doubt the affair would have blown
itself out harmlessly but for the fact that Chance
had other ideas. She has a way with her, this
Pagan Madonna, of taking off the cheerful motley
of a jest and substituting the Phrygian cap of
terror, subitaneously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>Dennison had lain down on the lounge in the
main salon. Restless, unhappy, bitter toward his
father, he had lain there counting the throbs of the
engine to that point where they mysteriously cease
to register and one has to wait a minute or two to
pick up the throb again.</p>
<p>For years he had lived more or less in the open,
which attunes the human ear to sounds that
generally pass unnoticed. All at once he was sure
that he had heard the tinkle of glass, but he
waited. The tinkle was repeated. Instinct led
him at once to the forward passage, and one
glance down this was sufficient. From the thought
of a drunken orgy&mdash;the thing he had been fearing
since the beginning of this mad voyage&mdash;his
thought leaped to Jane. Thus his subsequent
acts were indirectly in her defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil are you up to there?&#8221; he
called.</p>
<p>The unexpectedness of the challenge disconcerted
the men. They had enough loot. A quick
retreat, and Dennison would have had nothing
to do but close the dry-stores door. But middle
twenties are belligerent rather than discreet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got to say about it?&#8221; jeered one of
the men, shifting his brace of bottles to the arms
of another and squaring off.</p>
<p>Dennison rushed them, and the mêlée began.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
It was a strenuous affair while it lasted. When a
strong man is full of anger and bitter disappointment,
when six young fellows are bored to distraction,
nothing is quite so satisfying as an exchange
of fisticuffs. Dennison had the advantage
of being able to hit right and left, at random,
while his opponents were not always sure that a
blow landed where it was directed.</p>
<p>Naturally the racket drew Cleigh to the scene,
and he arrived in time to see a champagne bottle
descend upon the head of his son. Dennison went
down.</p>
<p>Cleigh, boiling with impotent fury, had gone to
bed, not to sleep but to plan; some way round the
rogue, to trip him and regain the treasures that
meant so much to him. Like father, like son.
When he saw what was going on in the passage he
saw also that here was something that linked up
with his mood. Of course it was to defend the
son; but without the bitter rage and the need of
physical expression he would have gone for the
hidden revolver and settled the affair with that.
Instead he flew at the men with the savageness of
a gray wolf. He was a tower of a man, for all his
sixty years; and he had mauled three of the crew
severely before Cunningham arrived.</p>
<p>Why had the mutinous six offered battle? Why
hadn&#8217;t they retreated with good sense at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
start? Originally all they had wanted was the
wine. Why stop to fight when the wine was
theirs? In the morning none of them could answer
these questions. Was there ever a rough-and-tumble
that anybody could explain lucidly the
morning after? Perhaps it was the false pride of
youth; the bitter distaste at the thought of six
turning tail for one.</p>
<p>Cunningham fired a shot at the ceiling, and a
dozen of the crew came piling in from the forward
end of the passage. The fighting stopped magically.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fools!&#8221; cried Cunningham in a high,
cracked voice. &#8220;To put our heads into hemp at
the last moment. If anything happens to young
Cleigh, back to Manila you go with the yacht!
Clear out! At the last moment!&#8221; It was like a
sob.</p>
<p>Jane, still entranced, saw Cleigh stoop and put
his arms under the body of his son, heave, and
stand up under the dead weight. He staggered
past her toward the main salon. She heard him
mutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;God help me if I&#8217;m too late&mdash;if I&#8217;ve waited
too long! Denny?&#8221;</p>
<p>That galvanized her into action, and she flew
to the light buttons, flooding both the dining and
the main salons. She helped Cleigh to place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Dennison on the lounge. After that it was her
affair. Dennison was alive, but how much alive
could be told only by the hours. She bathed and
bandaged his head. Beyond that she could do
nothing but watch and wait.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind&mdash;a little of that&mdash;water,&#8221;
said Cunningham, weakly.</p>
<p>Cleigh, with menacing fists, wheeled upon him;
but he did not strike the man who was basically
the cause of Denny&#8217;s injuries. At the same time
Jane, looking up across Dennison&#8217;s body, uttered a
gasp of horror. The entire left side of Cunningham
was drenched in blood, and the arm dangled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flint had a knife&mdash;and&mdash;was quite handy with
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;For defending me!
Mr. Cleigh, Flint caught me on deck&mdash;and Mr.
Cunningham&mdash;oh, this is horrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right, Cleigh. The best-laid plans of
mice and men! What an ass I am! I honestly
thought I could play a game like this without
hurt to anybody. It was to be a whale of a joke.
Flint&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham reached blindly for the nearest
chair and collapsed in it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An hour later. The four of them were still
in the main salon. Jane sat at the head of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
lounge, and from time to time she took Dennison&#8217;s
pulse and temperature. She had finally deduced
that there had been no serious concussion. Cleigh
sat at the foot of the lounge, his head on his hands.
Cunningham occupied the chair into which he had
collapsed. Three ugly flesh wounds, but nothing
a little time would not heal. True, he had had a
narrow squeak. He sat with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Jane suddenly, breaking the
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Cleigh, looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why these seven years&mdash;if you cared? I heard
you say something about being too late. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a queer old fool. An idea, when it enters
my head, sticks. I can&#8217;t shift my plans easily; I
have to go through. What you have witnessed
these several days gives you the impression that I
have no heart. That isn&#8217;t true. But we Cleighs
are pigheaded. Until he was sent to Russia he
was never from under the shadow of my hand.
My agents kept me informed of all his moves,
his adventures. The mistake was originally mine.
I put him in charge of an old scholar who taught
him art, music, languages, but little or nothing
about human beings. I gave him a liberal allowance;
but he was a queer lad, and Broadway never
heard of him. Now I hold that youth must
have its fling in some manner or other; after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
thirty there is no cure for folly. So when he ran
away I let him go; but he never got so far away
that I did not know what he was doing. I liked
the way he rejected the cash I gave him; the way
he scorned to trade upon the name. He went
clean. Why? I don&#8217;t know. Oh, yes, he got hilariously
drunk once in a while, but he had his
fling in clean places. I had agents watching him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he run away?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;No man can tell another man; a man has to
find it out for himself&mdash;the difference between a
good woman and a bad one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I play that statement to win,&#8221; interposed
Cunningham without opening his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a woman?&#8221; said Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bad one. Pretty and clever as sin. My
fault. I should have sent him to college where
he&#8217;d have got at least a glimmer of life. But I
kept him under the tutor until the thing happened.
He thought he was in love, when it was only his
first woman. She wanted his money&mdash;or, more
properly speaking, mine. I had her investigated
and found that she was bad all through. When
I told him boldly what she was he called me a liar.
I struck him across the mouth, and he promptly
knocked me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good punch for a youngster,&#8221; was
Cunningham&#8217;s comment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; replied Cleigh, grimly. &#8220;He went
directly to his room, packed, and cleared out. In
that he acted wisely, for at that moment I would
have cast him out had he come with an apology.
But the following day I could not find him; nor did
I get track of him until weeks later. He had
married the woman and then found her out.
That&#8217;s all cleared off the slate, though. She&#8217;s been
married and divorced three times since then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you expect to see him over here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Shanghai? No. The sight of him rather
knocked me about. You understand? It was
his place to make the first sign. He was in the
wrong, and he has known it all these seven
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;it was your place to make the
first advance. If you had been a comrade to him
in his boyhood he would never have been in the
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I gave him everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything but love. Did you ever tell him
a fairy story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fairy story!&#8221; Cleigh&#8217;s face was the essence
of bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You put him in the care of a lovable old
dreamer, and then expected him to accept life as
you knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh rumpled his cowlicks. A fairy story?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
But that was nonsense! Fairy stories had long
since gone out of fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw you two together an idea popped
into my head. But do you care for the boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I care everything for him&mdash;or I shouldn&#8217;t be
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cunningham relaxed a little more in his chair,
his eyes still closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; demanded Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I let you abduct me. I thought, maybe, if I
were near you for a little I might bring you two
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now!&#8221; said Cleigh, falling into the old
New England vernacular which was his birthright.
&#8220;I brought you on board merely to lure him after
you. I wanted you both on board so I could observe
you. I intended to carry you both off on a
cruise. I watched you from the door that night
while you two were dining. I saw by his face and
his gestures that he would follow you anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I am only a professional nurse. I&#8217;m
nobody! I haven&#8217;t anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord, will you listen to that?&#8221; cried the
pirate, with a touch of his old banter. &#8220;Nobody
and nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Jane nor Cleigh apparently heard this
interpolation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you maltreat him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise he would have thought I was offering
my hand, that I had weakened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you expected him to fall on your shoulder
and ask your pardon after that? Mr. Cleigh, for
a man of your intellectual attainments, your stand
is the biggest piece of stupidity I ever heard of!
How in the world was he to know what your
thoughts were?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was giving him his chance,&#8221; declared Cleigh,
stubbornly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A yacht? It&#8217;s a madhouse,&#8221; gibed Cunningham.
&#8220;And this is a convention of fools!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you want me to act?&#8221; asked Cleigh,
surrendering absolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he comes to, take his hand. You don&#8217;t
have to say anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Dennison&#8217;s lips came a deep, long sigh.
Jane leaned over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>The lids of Dennison&#8217;s eyes rolled back heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane&mdash;all right?&#8221; he asked, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. How do you feel?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached out a hand whence her voice came.
She met the hand with hers, and that seemed to be
all he wanted just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better get your bathrobe, Mr. Cleigh,&#8221;
she suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>Cleigh became conscious for the first time of the
condition of his pyjama jacket. It hung upon his
torso in mere ribbons. He became conscious also
of the fact that his body ached variously and
substantially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-odd years since I was in a racket like
this. I&#8217;m getting along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And on the way,&#8221; put in Cunningham, &#8220;you
might call Cleve. I&#8217;d feel better&mdash;stretched out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I had forgotten!&#8221; cried Jane, reproaching
herself. Weakened as he was, and sitting in a
chair!</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget, Cleigh, that I&#8217;m master of
the <i>Wanderer</i> until I leave it. I sympathize
deeply,&#8221; Cunningham went on, ironically, &#8220;but I
have some active troubles of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And God send they abide with you always!&#8221;
was Cleigh&#8217;s retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will&mdash;if that will give you any comfort.
Do you know what? You will always have me to
thank for this. That will be my comforting
thought. The god in the car!&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, when Cleve helped Cunningham into
his bunk, the latter asked about the crew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scared stiff. They realize that it was a close
shave. I&#8217;ve put the fools in irons. They&#8217;re best
there until we leave. But we can&#8217;t do anything
but forget the racket when we board the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Dutchman. Where&#8217;s that man Flint? We can&#8217;t find
him anywhere. He&#8217;s at the bottom of it. I
knew that sooner or later there&#8217;d be the devil to
pay with a woman on board. Probably the fool&#8217;s
hiding in the bunkers. I&#8217;ll give every rat hole
a look-see. Pretty nearly got you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flint was out of luck&mdash;and so was I! I
thought in pistols, and forgot that there might be a
knife or two. I&#8217;ll be on my feet in the morning.
Little weak, that&#8217;s all. Nobody and nothing!&#8221;
said Cunningham, addressing the remark to the
crossbeam above his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Cleve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking out loud. Get back to the
chart house. Old Newton may play us some
trick if he isn&#8217;t watched. And don&#8217;t bother to
search for Flint. I know where he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in Cunningham&#8217;s tone coldly touched
Cleve&#8217;s spine. He went out, closing the door
quietly; and there was reason for the sudden sweat
in his palms.</p>
<p>Chance! A wry smile stirred one corner of
Cunningham&#8217;s mouth. He had boasted that he
had left nothing to chance, with this result!
Burning up! Inward and outward fires! Love
beads! Well, what were they if not that? But
that she would trust him when everything about
him should have repelled her! Was there a nugget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
of forgotten gold in his cosmos, and had she discovered
it? She still trusted him, for he had
sensed it in the quick but tender touch of her
hands upon his throbbing wounds.</p>
<p>To learn, after all these years, that he had been
a coward! To have run away from misfortune
instead of facing it and beating it down!</p>
<p>Pearls! All he had left! And when he found
them, what then? Turn them into money he no
longer cared to spend? Or was this an interlude&mdash;a
mocking interlude, and would to-morrow see
his conscience relegated to the dustbin out of
which it had so oddly emerged?</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Dennison opened his eyes again Jane was
still holding his hand. Upon beholding his father
Dennison held out his free hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take it, Father? I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll take it, Denny. I was an old
fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was a young one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like a cup of coffee?&#8221; Cleigh asked,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it won&#8217;t be too much trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>A hand pressure, a few inconsequent phrases,
that is always enough for two strong characters in
the hour of reconciliation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>Cleigh out of the way, Jane tried to disengage
her hand, but Dennison only tightened his grip.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8221;&mdash;a pause&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s different now. The old
boy will find some kind of a job for me. Will you
marry me, Jane? I did not speak before, because
I hadn&#8217;t anything to offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t offer marriage until I had a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But supposing your father doesn&#8217;t give you
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor boy! I&#8217;m only fishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why do you want to marry me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it, because I love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me that in the first place?
How was I to know unless you told me? But oh,
Denny, I want to go home!&#8221; She laid her cheek
against his hand. &#8220;I want a garden with a picket
fence round it and all the simple flowers. I never
want another adventure in all my days!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here!&#8221;</p>
<p>A stretch of silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone hit you with a wine bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A vintage&mdash;and I never got a swallow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then your father went to your defense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old boy? Honestly?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He stood astride your body until Mr. Cunningham
came in and stopped the mêlée.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cunningham! They quit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Flint. I didn&#8217;t dream it wouldn&#8217;t be
safe to go on deck, and Flint caught me. He was
drunk. But for Cunningham, I don&#8217;t know what
would have happened. I ran and left them
fighting, and Flint wounded Cunningham with a
knife. It was for me, Denny. I feel so sorry for
him! So alone, hating himself and hating the
world, tortured with misunderstanding&mdash;good in
him that he keeps smothering and trampling down.
His unbroken word&mdash;to hang to that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. So far as I&#8217;m concerned, that cleans
the slate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved you, Denny, but I didn&#8217;t know how
much until I saw you on the floor. Do you know
what I was going to demand of your father as a
reparation for bringing me on board? His hand
in yours. That was all I wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always thinking of someone else!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all the happiness I&#8217;ve ever had, Denny&mdash;until
now!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p>A good deal of orderly commotion took
place the following morning. Cunningham&#8217;s
crew, under the temporary leadership
of Cleve, proceeded to make everything shipshape.
There was no exuberance; they went at
the business quietly and grimly. They sensed a
shadow overhead. The revolt of the six discovered
to the others what a rickety bridge they
were crossing, how easily and swiftly a jest may
become a tragedy.</p>
<p>They had accepted the game as a kind of huge
joke. Everything had been prepared against
failure; it was all cut and dried; all they had to do
was to believe themselves. For days they had
gone about their various duties thinking only of the
gay time that would fall to their lot when they left
the <i>Wanderer</i>. The possibility that Cleigh would
not proceed in the manner advanced by Cunningham&#8217;s
psychology never bothered them until now.
Supposing the old man&#8217;s desire for vengeance was
stronger than his love for his art objects? He was
a fighter; he had proved it last night. Supposing he
put up a fight and called in the British to help him?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>Not one of them but knew what the penalty
would be if pursued and caught. But Cunningham
had persuaded them up to this hour that they
would not even be pursued; that it would not be
humanly possible for Cleigh to surrender the hope
of eventually recovering his unlawful possessions.
And now they began to wonder, to fret secretly, to
reconsider the ancient saying that the way of the
transgressor is hard.</p>
<p>On land they could have separated and hidden
successfully. Here at sea the wireless was an
inescapable net. Their only hope was to carry
on. Cunningham might pull them through. For,
having his own hide to consider, he would bring to
bear upon the adventure all his formidable ingenuity.</p>
<p>At eleven the commotion subsided magically
and the men vanished below, but at four-thirty
they swarmed the port bow, silently if interestedly.
If they talked at all it was in a whispering undertone.</p>
<p>The mutinous revellers formed a group of their
own. They appeared to have been roughly
handled by the Cleighs. The attitude was humble,
the expression worriedly sorrowful. Why hadn&#8217;t
they beat a retreat? The psychology of their madness
escaped them utterly. There was one grain
of luck&mdash;they hadn&#8217;t killed young Cleigh. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
fool had swung that bottle? Not one of them
could recall.</p>
<p>The engines of the <i>Wanderer</i> stopped, and she
rolled lazily in the billowing brass, waiting.</p>
<p>Out of the blinding topaz of the sou&#8217;west nosed
a black object, illusory. It appeared to ride
neither wind nor water.</p>
<p>From the bridge Cleigh eyed this object dourly,
and with a swollen heart he glanced from time
to time at the crates and casings stacked below.
He knew that he would never set eyes upon any
of these treasures again. When they were lowered
over the side that would be the end of them. Cunningham
might be telling the truth as to his
intentions; but he was promising something that
was not conceivably possible, any more than it was
possible to play at piracy and not get hurt.</p>
<p>At Cleigh&#8217;s side stood the son, his head swathed
in bandages. All day long he had been subjected
to splitting headaches, and his face looked tired
and drawn. He had stayed in bed until he had
heard &#8220;Ship ahoy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to start something?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Cleigh did not answer, but peered through the
glass again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you&#8217;re going to land him without
the British. On the other hand, you can&#8217;t
tell. Cunningham might bring the stuff back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>Cleigh laughed, but still held the glass to his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;When and where are you going to get married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Manila. Jane wants to go home, and I want
a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh touched his split lips and his bruised
cheekbone, for he had had to pay for his gallantry;
and there was a spot in his small ribs that
racked him whenever he breathed deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil do you want of a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not thinking that I&#8217;m going back on an
allowance? I&#8217;ve had independence for seven
years, and I&#8217;m going to keep it, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve money enough&#8221;&mdash;brusquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t it. I want to begin somewhere and
build something for myself. You know as well
as I do that if I went home on an allowance you&#8217;d
begin right off to dominate me as you used to, and
no man is going to do that again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve got to
find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh lowered the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see; didn&#8217;t you work on a sugar plantation
somewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. How&#8217;d you find that out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that. I can give you a
job, and it won&#8217;t be soft, either. I&#8217;ve a sugar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
plantation in Hawaii that isn&#8217;t paying the dividends
it ought to. I&#8217;ll turn the management over
to you. You make good the second year, or back
you come to me, domination and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree to that&mdash;if the plantation can be
developed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stuff is there; all it needs is some pep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll take the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and your wife shall spend the fall and
winter with me. In February you can start to
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you out for Cunningham&#8217;s hide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do in my place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit tight and wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh laughed sardonically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; went on Dennison, &#8220;he&#8217;s played the
game too shrewdly not to have other cards up his
sleeve. He may find his pearls and return the
loot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe that? Don&#8217;t talk like a fool!
I tell you, his pearls are in those casings there!
But, son, I&#8217;m glad to have you back. And you&#8217;ve
found a proper mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she glorious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than that. She&#8217;s the kind that&#8217;ll always
be fussing over you, and that&#8217;s the kind a
man needs. But mind your eye! Don&#8217;t take it
for granted! Make her want to fuss over you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>When the oncoming tramp reached a point four
hundred yards to the southwest of the yacht she
slued round broadside. For a moment or two the
reversed propeller&mdash;to keep the old tub from drifting&mdash;threw
up a fountain; and before the sudsy
eddies had subsided the longboat began a jerky
descent. No time was going to be wasted evidently.</p>
<p>The <i>Haarlem</i>&mdash;or whatever name was written
on her ticket&mdash;was a picture. Even her shadows
tried to desert her as she lifted and wallowed in the
long, burnished rollers. There was something astonishingly
impudent about her. She reminded
Dennison of an old gin-sodden female derelict of
the streets. There were red patches all over her,
from stem to stern, where the last coat of waterproof
black had blistered off. The brass of her
ports were green. Her name should have been
Neglect. She was probably full of smells; and
Dennison was ready to wager that in a moderate
sea her rivets and bedplates whined, and that the
pump never rested.</p>
<p>But it occurred to him that there must be some
basis of fact in Cunningham&#8217;s pearl atoll, and
yonder owner was game enough to take a sporting
chance; that, or he had been handsomely paid for
his charter.</p>
<p>An atoll in the Sulu Archipelago that had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
overlooked&mdash;that was really the incredible part of
it. Dennison had first-hand knowledge that there
wasn&#8217;t a rock in the whole archipelago that had
not been looked over and under by the pearl
hunters.</p>
<p>He saw the tramp&#8217;s longboat come staggering
across the intervening water. Rag-tag and bob-tail
of the Singapore docks, crimp fodder&mdash;that
was what Dennison believed he had the right to
expect. And behold! Except that they were
older, the newcomers lined up about average with
the departing&mdash;able seamen.</p>
<p>The transshipping of the crews occupied about
an hour. As the longboat&#8217;s boat hook caught the
<i>Wanderer&#8217;s</i> ladder for the third time the crates and
casings were carried down and carefully deposited
in the stern sheets.</p>
<p>About this time Cunningham appeared. He
paused by the rail for a minute and looked up at
the Cleighs, father and son. He was pale, and his
attitude suggested pain and weakness, but he was
not too weak to send up his bantering smile.
Cleigh, senior, gazed stonily forward, but Dennison
answered the smile by soberly shaking his
head. Dennison could not hear Cunningham&#8217;s
laugh, but he saw the expression of it.</p>
<p>Cunningham put his hand on the rail in preparation
for the first step, when Jane appeared with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
bandages, castile soap, the last of her stearate of
zinc, absorbent cotton and a basin of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this&mdash;a clinic?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go aboard that awful-looking ship
without letting me give you a fresh dressing,&#8221; she
declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love you, angel of mercy, I&#8217;m all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was for me. Even now you are in pain.
Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pain?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>For one more touch of her tender hands! To
carry the thought of that through the long, hot
night! Perhaps it was his ever-bubbling sense of
malice that decided him&mdash;to let her minister to
him, with the Cleighs on the bridge to watch and
boil with indignation. He nodded, and she followed
him to the hatch, where he sat down.</p>
<p>Dennison saw his father&#8217;s hands strain on the
bridge rail, the presage of a gathering storm. He
intervened by a rough seizure of Cleigh&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Father! Not a word of reproach
out of you when she comes up&mdash;God bless her!
Anything in pain! It&#8217;s her way, and I&#8217;ll not have
her reproached. God alone knows what the beggar
saved her from last night! If you utter a word
I&#8217;ll cash that twenty thousand&mdash;it&#8217;s mine now&mdash;and
you&#8217;ll never see either of us after Manila!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh gently disengaged his arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sonny, you&#8217;ve got a man&#8217;s voice under your
shirt these days. All right. Run down and give
the new crew the once-over, and see if they have a
wireless man among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Sunset&mdash;a scarlet horizon and an old-rose sea.
For a little while longer the trio on the bridge could
discern a diminishing black speck off to the southeast.
The <i>Wanderer</i> was boring along a point
north of east, Manila way. The speck soon lost
its blackness and became violet, and then magically
the streaked horizon rose up behind the
speck and obliterated it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor benighted thing!&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;God
didn&#8217;t mean that he should be this kind of a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does any of us know what God wants of us?&#8221;
asked Cleigh, bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants men like you who pretend to the
world that they&#8217;re granite-hearted when they&#8217;re
not. Ever since we started, Denny, I&#8217;ve been trying
to recall where I&#8217;d seen your father before; and
it came a little while ago. I saw him only once&mdash;a
broken child he&#8217;d brought to the hospital to be
mended. I happened to be passing through the
children&#8217;s ward for some reason. He called himself
Jones or Brown or Smith&mdash;I forget. But they
told me afterward that he brought on an average
of four children a month, and paid all expenses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
until they were ready to go forth, if not cured at
least greatly bettered. He told the chief that if
anybody ever followed him he would never come
back. Your father&#8217;s a hypocrite, Denny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s where I saw you?&#8221; said Cleigh,
ruminatively. He expanded a little. He wanted
the respect and admiration of this young woman&mdash;his
son&#8217;s wife-to-be. &#8220;Don&#8217;t weave any golden
halo for me,&#8221; he added, dryly. &#8220;After Denny
packed up and hiked it came back rather hard that
I hadn&#8217;t paid much attention to his childhood. It
was a kind of penance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you liked it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I only got used to it. Say, Denny,
was there a wireless man in the crew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I knew there wouldn&#8217;t be. But I can
handle the key.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine! Come along then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do? Why, I&#8217;m going to have the Asiatic
fleets on his heels inside of twenty-four hours!
That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do! He&#8217;s an unprincipled
rogue!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; interposed Jane, &#8220;only a poor broken
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no fault of mine. But no man can
play this sort of game with me, and show a clean
pair of heels. The rug and the paintings are gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
for good. I swore to him that I would have
his hide, and have it I will! I never break my
word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;for my sake you will not
touch the wireless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m giving the orders!&#8221; roared Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment!&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;You spoke of
your word. That first night you promised me any
reparation I should demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made that promise. Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him his eight months.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gestured toward the sea, toward the spot
where they had last seen the <i>Haarlem</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You demand that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I only ask it. I understand the workings
of that twisted soul, and you don&#8217;t. Let him have
his queer dream&mdash;his boyhood adventure. Are
you any better than he? Were those treasures
honourably yours? Fie! No, I won&#8217;t demand
that you let him go; I&#8217;ll only ask it. Because
you will not deny to me what you gave to those
little children&mdash;generosity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to love you,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;but I
couldn&#8217;t if there was no mercy in your sense of
justice. Be merciful to that unhappy outcast,
who probably never had any childhood, or if he
had, a miserable one. Children are heartless; they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
don&#8217;t know any better. They pointed the finger
of ridicule and contempt at him&mdash;his playmates.
Imagine starting life like that! And he told me
that the first woman he loved&mdash;laughed in his
face! I feel&mdash;I don&#8217;t know why&mdash;that he was always
without care, from his childhood up. He
looked so forlorn! Eight months! We need
never tell him. I&#8217;d rather he shouldn&#8217;t know that
I tried to intercede for him. But for him we
three would not be here together, with understanding.
I only ask it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh turned and went down the ladder.
Twenty times he circled the deck; then he paused
under the bridge and sent up a hail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner is ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment Jane reached the deck Cleigh put
an arm round her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No other human being could have done it.
It is a cup of gall and wormwood, but I&#8217;ll take it.
Why? Because I am old and lonely and want a
little love. I have no faith in Cunningham&#8217;s
word, but he shall go free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long since you kissed any one?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many years.&#8221; And he stooped to her cheek.
To press back the old brooding thought he said
with cheerful brusqueness: &#8220;Suppose we celebrate?
I&#8217;ll have Togo ice a bottle of that vintage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
those infernal ruffians broke over your head last
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison laughed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>October.</p>
<p>The Cleigh library was long and wide. There
was a fine old blue Ispahan on the floor. The
chairs were neither historical nor uncomfortable.
One came in here to read. The library was on the
second floor. When you reached this room you
left the affairs of state and world behind.</p>
<p>A wood fire crackled and shifted in the fireplace,
the marble hood of which had been taken from a
famous Italian palace. The irons stood ready as
of yore for the cups of mulled wine. Before this
fire sat a little old woman knitting. Her feet were
on a hassock. From time to time her bird-like
glance swept the thinker in the adjacent chair.
She wondered what he could see in the fire there
to hold his gaze so steadily. The little old lady
had something of the attitude of a bird that had
been given its liberty suddenly, and having always
lived in a cage knew not what to make of all these
vast spaces.</p>
<p>She was Jane&#8217;s mother, and sitting in the chair
beside her was Anthony Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are said to be only five portable authentic
paintings by Leonardo da Vinci,&#8221; said Cleigh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
&#8220;and I had one of them, Mother. Illegally, perhaps,
but still I had it. It is a copy that hangs in
the European gallery. There&#8217;s a point. Gallery
officials announce a theft only when some expert
had discovered the substitution. There are a
number of so-called Da Vincis, but those are the
works of Boltraffio, Da Vinci&#8217;s pupil. I&#8217;ll always
be wondering, even in my grave, where that crook,
Eisenfeldt, had disposed of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Norman went on with her knitting. What
she heard was as instructive and illuminating to
her as Chinese would have been.</p>
<p>From the far end of the room came piano music;
gentle, dreamy, broken occasionally by some fine,
thrilling chord. Dennison played well, but he had
the habit of all amateurs of idling, of starting something,
and running away into improvisations.
Seated beside him on the bench was Jane, her head
inclined against his shoulder. Perhaps that was
a good reason why he began a composition and did
not carry it through to its conclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a trick of his mother&#8217;s,&#8221; said Cleigh,
still addressing the fire. &#8220;All the fine things in
him he got from her. I gave him his shoulders,
but I guess that&#8217;s about all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Norman did not turn her head. She had
already learned that she wasn&#8217;t expected to reply
unless Cleigh looked at her directly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a high wind outside. More rain,
probably. But that&#8217;s October in these parts.
You&#8217;ll like it in Hawaii. Never any of this brand
of weather. I may be able to put the yacht into
commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sea!&#8221; she said in a little frightened whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doorbells!&#8221; said Dennison with gentle mockery.
&#8220;Jane, you&#8217;re always starting up when you
hear one. Still hanging on? It isn&#8217;t Cunningham&#8217;s
willingness to fulfill his promise; it&#8217;s his
ability I doubt. A thousand and one things may
upset his plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. But, win or lose, he was to let me
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor devil! I never dared say so to
Father, but when I learned that Cunningham
meant no harm to you I began to boost for him. I
like to see a man win against huge odds, and that&#8217;s
what he has been up against.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny, I&#8217;ve never asked before; I&#8217;ve been a
little afraid to, but did you see Flint when the
crew left?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I honestly didn&#8217;t notice; I was so interested
in the disreputable old hooker that was to take
them off.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed. Fragments of that night were always
recurring in her dreams.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>The door opened and the ancient butler entered.
His glance roved until it caught the little tuft of
iron-gray hair that protruded above the rim of the
chair by the fire. Noiselessly he crossed the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but a van arrived
a few minutes ago with a number of packing cases.
The men said they were for you, sir. The cases are
in the lower hall. Any orders, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cases? Benson, did you say&mdash;cases?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I fancy some paintings you&#8217;ve
ordered, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh stood perfectly still. The butler eyed
him with mild perturbation. Rarely he saw bewilderment
on his master&#8217;s countenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cases?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Fourteen or fifteen of them, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh felt oddly numb. For days now he had
denied to himself the reason for his agitation whenever
the telephone or doorbell rang. Hope! It
had not served to crush it down, to buffet it aside
by ironical commentaries on the weakness of human
nature; the thing was uncrushable, insistent.
Packing cases!</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny! Jane!&#8221; he cried, and bolted for the
door.</p>
<p>The call needed no interpretation. The two
understood, and followed him downstairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
precipitately, with the startled Benson the tail to the
kite.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; shouted Cleigh. &#8220;The big one
first!&#8221; as Dennison laid one of the smaller cases
on the floor. &#8220;Benson, where the devil is the claw
hammer?&#8221;</p>
<p>The butler foraged in the coat closet and
presently emerged with a prier. Cleigh literally
snatched it from the astonished butler&#8217;s grasp,
pried and tore off a board. He dug away at the
excelsior until he felt the cool glass under his
fingers. He peered through this glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny, it&#8217;s the rug!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh&#8217;s voice cracked and broke into a queer
treble note.</p>
<p>Jane shook her head. Here was an incurable
passion, based upon the specious argument that
galleries and museums had neither consciences nor
stomachs. You could not hurt a wall by robbing
it of a painting&mdash;a passion that would abide with
him until death. Not one of these treasures in
the casings was honourably his, but they were more
to him than all his legitimate possessions. To ask
him to return the objects to the galleries and
museums to which they belonged would be asking
Cleigh to tear out his heart. Though the passion
was incomprehensible, Jane readily observed its
effects. She had sensed the misery, the anxiety,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
the stinging curiosity of all these months. Not to
know exactly what had become of the rug and the
paintings! Not to know if he would ever see them
again! There was only one comparison she could
bring to bear as an illustration: Cleigh was like
a man whose mistress had forsaken him without
explanations.</p>
<p>She was at once happy and sad: happy that her
faith in Cunningham had not been built upon sand,
sad that she could not rouse Cleigh&#8217;s conscience.
Secretly a charitable man, honest in his financial
dealings, he could keep&mdash;in hiding, mind you!&mdash;that
which did not belong to him. It was beyond
her understanding.</p>
<p>An idea, which had been nebulous until this
moment, sprang into being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you will do me a favour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want&mdash;a million? Run and get
my check book!&#8221; he cried, gayly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other day you spoke of making a new will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh stared at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you leave these objects to the legal
owners?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh got up, brushing his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;After I am dead? I never thought of that.
After I&#8217;m dead,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Child, a conscience
like yours is top-heavy. Still, I&#8217;ll mull it
over. I can&#8217;t take &#8217;em to the grave with me, that&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
a fact. But my ghost is bound to get leg-weary
doing the rounds to view them again. What do
you say, Denny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes it unanimous. I&#8217;ll put it in the
codicil. But while I live! Benson, what did
these men look like? One of them limp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. Ordinary trucking men, I should
say, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The infernal scoundrel! No message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. The man who rang the bell said he
had some cases for you, and asked where he should
put them. I thought the hall the best place, sir,
temporarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The infernal scoundrel!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the dickens is the matter with you,
Father!&#8221; demanded Dennison. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got back
the loot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how? The story, Denny! The rogue
leaves me &#8217;twixt wind and water as to how he got
out of this hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he was afraid you still wanted his
hide,&#8221; suggested Jane, now immeasurably happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did it!&#8221; said Cleigh, his sense of amazement
awakening. &#8220;One chance in a thousand,
and he caught that chance! But never to know
how he did it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad now,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;that you
let him go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cleigh chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she exclaimed, clapping her hands.
&#8220;Just as he said! He prophesied that some day
you would chuckle over it. He found his pearls.
He knew he would find them! The bell!&#8221; she
broke off, startled.</p>
<p>Never had Benson, the butler, witnessed such
an exhibition of undignified haste. Cleigh, Jane,
and Dennison, all three of them started for the
door at once, jostling. What they found was only
a bedraggled messenger boy, for it was now raining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cleigh,&#8221; said the boy, grumpily, as he
presented a letter and a small box. &#8220;No answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the man who sent you?&#8221; asked Jane,
tremendously excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;De office pushed me on dis job, miss. Dey
said maybe I&#8217;d git a good tip if I hustled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dennison thrust a bill into the boy&#8217;s hand and
shunted him forth into the night again.</p>
<p>The letter was marked Number One and addressed
to Cleigh; the box was marked Number
Two and addressed to Jane.</p>
<p>Mad, thought Benson, as he began to gather up
the loose excelsior; quite mad, the three of them.</p>
<p>With Jane at one shoulder and Dennison at the
other, Cleigh opened his letter. The first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
extraction was a chart. An atoll; here were
groups of cocoanut palm, there of plantain; a rudely
drawn hut. In the lagoon at a point east of
north was a red star, and written alongside was
a single word. But to the three it was an Odyssey&mdash;&#8220;Shell.&#8221;
In the lower left-hand corner of the
chart were the exact degrees and minutes of longitude
and latitude. With this chart a landlubber
could have gone straight to the atoll.</p>
<p>Next came the letter, which Cleigh did not read
aloud&mdash;it was not necessary. With what variant
emotions the three pairs of eyes leaped from word
to word!</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Friend Buccaneer</span>: Of course I found the shell. That was
the one issue which offered no odds. The shell lay in its bed
peculiarly under a running ledge. The ordinary pearler
would have discovered it only by the greatest good luck.
Atherton&mdash;my friend&mdash;discovered it, because he was a sea
naturalist, and was hunting for something altogether different.
Atherton was wealthy, and a coral reef was more to him than a
pearl. But he knew me and what such a game would mean.
He was in ill health and had to leave the South Pacific and
fare north. This atoll was his. It is now mine, pearls and
all, legally mine. For a trifling sum I could have chartered a
schooner and sought the atoll.</p>
<p>But all my life I&#8217;ve hunted odds&mdash;big, tremendous odds&mdash;to
crush down and swarm over. The only interest I had in life.
And so I planted the crew and stole the <i>Wanderer</i> because it
presented whopping odds. I selected a young and dare-devil
crew to keep me on edge. From one day to another I was always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
wondering when they would break over. I refused to
throw overboard the wines and liquors to make a good measure.</p>
<p>And there was you. Would you sit tight under such an
outrage, or would your want of revenge ride you? Would you
send the British piling on top of me, or would you make it a
private war? Suspense! Dick Cunningham would not be
hard to trace. Old Slue Foot. The biggest odds I&#8217;d ever
encountered. Nominally, I had about one chance in a
thousand of pulling through.</p>
<p>The presence of Mrs. Cleigh&mdash;of course she&#8217;s Mrs. Cleigh by
this time!&mdash;added to the zest. To bring her through with
nothing more than a scare! Odds, odds! Cleigh, on my
word, the pearls would have been of no value without the
game I built to go with them. Over the danger route! Mad?
Of course I&#8217;m mad!</p>
<p>Four-year-old shell, the pearls of the finest orient! The
shell alone&mdash;in buttons&mdash;would have recouped Eisenfeldt.
He was ugly when he saw that I had escaped him. Threatened
to expose you. But knowing Eisenfeldt for what he is, I had
a little sword of Damocles suspended over his thick neck.
The thought of having lost eight months&#8217; interest will follow
him to Hades.</p>
<p>The crew gave me no more trouble. They&#8217;ve been paid
their dividends in the Great Adventure Company, and have
gone seeking others. But I&#8217;ll warrant they&#8217;ll take only
regular berths in the future.</p>
<p>And now those beads. I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m also innocent. I
have learned that Morrissy really double-crossed us all. He
had had a copy made in Venice. The beads you have are
forgeries. So the sixty thousand offered by the French
Government remains uncalled for. Who has the originals I
can&#8217;t say. I&#8217;m sorry. Morrissy&#8217;s game was risky. His idea
was to make a sudden breakaway with the beads&mdash;lose them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
in the gutter&mdash;and trust to luck that we would just miss killing
him, which was the case.</p>
<p>Leaving to-night. Bought a sloop down there, and I&#8217;m
going back there to live. Tired of human beings. Tired of
myself. Still, there&#8217;s the chart. Mull it over. Maybe it&#8217;s
an invitation. The lagoon is like turquoise and the land like
emerald and the sky a benediction.</p>
</div>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A spell of silence and immobility. Not a word
about his battle with Flint, thought Jane. A
little shiver ran over her. But what a queer,
whimsical madman! To have planned it all so
that he could experience a thrill! The tragic
beauty of his face and the pitiable, sluing, lurching
stride! She sighed audibly, so did the two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Cleigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do!&#8221; said Dennison, anticipating his father&#8217;s
thought. &#8220;He&#8217;s a man, and some day I&#8217;d like to
clasp his hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we all shall,&#8221; said Cleigh. &#8220;But open
the box, Jane, and let&#8217;s see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Between the layers of cotton wool she found a
single pearl as large as a hazelnut, pink as the
Oriental dawn. One side was slightly depressed,
as though some mischievous, inquisitive mermaid
had touched it in passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the lovely thing!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;The
lovely thing! But, Denny, I can&#8217;t accept it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how are you going to refuse it? Keep it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
It is an emblem of what you are, honey. The
poor devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he put his arm round her. He understood.
Why not? There are certain attractions which
are irresistible, and Jane was unconscious of her
possessions.</p>
<p>Jane raised the bottom layer of cotton wool.
What impulse led her to do this she could not say,
but she found a slip of paper across which was
written:</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;<i>An&#8217; I learned about women from &#8217;er.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>All this while, across the street, in the shadow
of an areaway, stood a man in a mackintosh and a
felt hat drawn well down. He had watched the
van disgorge and roll away, the arrival and the
departure of the messenger boy.</p>
<p>He began to intone softly: &#8220;&#8216;Many waters
cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
it: if a man would give all the substance of his
house for love, it would utterly be contemned.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sluing lurch to his stride he started
off down the street, into the lashing rain. A
great joke; and now there was nothing at all to disturb
his dreams&mdash;but the dim white face of Jabez
Flint spinning in the dark of the sea.</p>
